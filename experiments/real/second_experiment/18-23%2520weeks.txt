Introduction
Ultrasound is the main diagnostic tool in the prenatal detection of congenital abnormalities. It allows 
examination of the external and internal anatomy of the fetus and the detection of not only major defects 
but also of subtle markers of chromosomal abnormalities and genetic syndromes. Although some women 
are at high risk of fetal abnormalities, either because of a family history or due to exposure to teratogens 
such as infection and various drugs, the vast majority of fetal abnormalities occur in the low-risk group. 
Consequently, ultrasound examination should be offered routinely to all pregnant women. The scan, which 
is usually performed at 18–23 weeks of pregnancy, should be carried out to a high standard and should 
include systematic examination of the fetus for the detection of both major and minor defects. 
The Fetal Medicine Foundation, under the auspices of the International Society of Ultrasound in Obstetrics 
and Gynecology and the International Society of Perinatal Medicine, has introduced a process of training 
and certification to help establish high standards of scanning on an international basis. The Certificate of 
Competence in the 18–23-week scan is awarded to those sonographers that can perform the scan to a 
high standard and can demonstrate a good knowledge of a wide spectrum of fetal abnormalities. 
This book, which summarizes the prevalence, etiology, prenatal sonographic features and prognosis for 
both common and rare fetal abnormalities, provides the basis of learning for the theoretical component of 
the Certificate of Competence in the 18–23-week scan.

Central nervous system 
NORMAL SONOGRAPHIC ANATOMY 
The fetal brain undergoes major developmental changes throughout pregnancy. At 7 weeks of gestation, a sonolucent 
area is seen in the cephalic pole, presumably representing the fluid-filled rhombencephalic vesicle. At 9 weeks, 
demonstration of the convoluted pattern of the three primary cerebral vesicles is feasible. From 11 weeks, the 
brightly echogenic choroid plexuses filling the large lateral ventricles are the most prominent intracranial structures. 
In the early second trimester, the lateral ventricles and choroid plexuses decrease in size relative to the brain mass. 
Examination of the fetal brain can essentially be carried out by two transverse planes, commonly referred to as the 
transventricular and the transcerebellar plane. 
The transventricular plane, obtained by a transverse scan at the level of the cavum septum pellucidum will 
demonstrate the lateral borders of the anterior (or frontal) horns, the medial and lateral borders of the posterior 
horns (or atria) of the lateral ventricles, the choroid plexuses and the Sylvian fissures. 

The transventricular view is used for measurement of the biparietal diameter (BPD), head circumference (HC), and 
width of the ventricles. 
The transcerebellar (or suboccipitobregmatic) view allows examination of the mid-brain and posterior fossa; this view 
is used for measurement of the transverse cerebellar diameter (TCD) and cisterna magna (CM). 
Additional scanning planes along different orientations may be required from time to time to better define subtle 
details of intracranial anatomy in selected cases. Reverberation artifacts usually obscure the cerebral hemisphere 
close to the transducer. Visualization of both cerebral hemispheres would require sagittal and coronal planes that are 
often difficult to obtain and may require vaginal sonography. 

Transvaginal Scan + Color Doppler (Sagittal plane) Vascularization of Brain (arrow -Pericallosal Artery) 
Luckily unilateral cerebral lesions are rare and are often associated with a shift in the midline echo. Therefore, we 
adhere to the approach that in standard examination only one hemisphere is seen, and symmetry is assumed unless 
otherwise proven. 
A sagittal and/or coronal view of the entire fetal spine should be obtained in each case. In the sagittal plane the 
normal spine has a 'double railway' appearance and it is possible to appreciate the intact soft tissues above it. In the 
coronal plane, the three ossification centers of the vertebra form three regular lines that tether down into the sacrum. 
These views are used to assess the integrity of the vertebrae (to rule out spina bifida) and the presence and 
regularity of the whole spine (to rule out sacral agenesis and scoliosis). 
Whether a systematic examination of each neural arch from the cervical to the sacral region in the transverse plane is 
necessary is debatable. This is certainly required for patients at high-risk of neural tube defects. In low-risk patients, 
intact cerebral anatomy rules out more than 90% of cases of spina bifida and we believe that the longitudinal / 
coronal scan may suffice. 
NEURAL TUBE DEFECTS 
These include anencephaly, spina bifida and encephalocele. In anencephaly there is absence of the cranial 
vault (acrania) with secondary degeneration of the brain. Encephaloceles are cranial defects, usually occipital, with 
herniated fluid-filled or brain-filled cysts. In spina bifida the neural arch, usually in the lumbosacral region, is 
incomplete with secondary damage to the exposed nerves. 
Prevalence 
This is subject to large geographical and temporal variations; in the UK the prevalence is about 5 per 1,000 births. 
Anencephaly and spina bifida, with an approximately equal prevalence, account for 95% of the cases and 
encephalocele for the remaining 5%. 
Etiology 
Chromosomal abnormalities, single mutant genes, and maternal diabetes mellitus or ingestion of teratogens, such as 
antiepileptic drugs, are implicated in about 10% of the cases. However, the precise etiology for the majority of these 
defects is unknown. When a parent or previous sibling has had a neural tube defect, the risk of recurrence is 5-10%. 

Periconceptual supplementation of the maternal diet with folate reduces by about half the risk of developing these 
defects. 
Diagnosis 
The diagnosis of anencephaly during the second trimester of pregnancy is based on the demonstration of absent 
cranial vault and cerebral hemispheres. However, the facial bones, brain stem and portions of the occipital bones and 
mid-brain are usually present. Associated spinal lesions are found in up to 50% of cases. In the first trimester the 
diagnosis can be made after 11 weeks, when ossification of the skull normally occurs. Ultrasound reports have 
demonstrated that there is progression from acrania to exencephaly and finally anencephaly. Not everyone agrees 
however, since acrania are defects of the mesenchymal layer and there is no evidence in the literature of recurrence 
rate. In the first trimester the pathognomonic feature is acrania, the brain being either entirely normal or at varying 
degrees of distortion and disruption. 
Anencephaly (3D view) 
Diagnosis of spina bifida requires the systematic examination of each neural arch from the cervical to the sacral 
region both transversely and longitudinally. In the transverse scan the normal neural arch appears as a closed circle 
with an intact skin covering, whereas in spina bifida the arch is 'U'-shaped and there is an associated bulging 
meningocele (thin-walled cyst) or myelomeningocoele. The extent of the defect and any associated kyphoscoliosis are 
best assessed in the longitudinal scan. 

The diagnosis of spina bifida has been greatly enhanced by the recognition of associated abnormalities in the skull 
and brain. These abnormalities are secondary to the Arnold-Chiari malformation and include frontal bone scalloping 
(lemon sign), and obliteration of the cisterna magna with either an "absent" cerebellum or abnormal anterior 
curvature of the cerebellar hemispheres (banana sign). 
These easily recognizable alterations in skull and brain morphology are often more readily attainable than detailed 
spinal views. A variable degree of ventricular enlargement is present in virtually all cases of open spina bifida at birth, 
but in only about 70% of cases in the mid-trimester. 
Encephaloceles are recognized as cranial defects with herniated fluid-filled or brain-filled cysts. They are most 
commonly found in an occipital location (75% of the cases) but alternative sites include the frontoethmoidal and 
parietal regions. 

Prognosis 
Anencephaly is fatal at or within hours of birth. In encephalocele the prognosis is inversely related to the amount of 
herniated cerebral tissue; overall the neonatal mortality is about 40% and more that 80% of survivors are 
intellectually and neurologically handicapped. In spina bifida the surviving infants are often severely handicapped, 
with paralysis in the lower limbs and double incontinence; despite the associated hydrocephalus requiring surgery, 
intelligence may be normal. 
Fetaltherapy 
There is some experimental evidence that in utero closure of spina bifida may reduce the risk of handicap because the 
amniotic fluid in the third trimester is thought to be neurotoxic. 
HYDROCEPHALUS AND VENTRICULOMEGALY 
In hydrocephalus there is pathological increase in the size of the cerebral ventricles. 
Prevalence 
Hydrocephalus is found in about 2 per 1,000 births. Ventriculomegaly (lateral ventricle diameter of 10 mm or more) is 
found in 1% of pregnancies at the 18-23 week scan. Therefore the majority of fetuses with ventriculomegaly do not 
develop hydrocephalus. 
Etiology 
This may result from chromosomal and genetic abnormalities, intrauterine hemorrhage or congenital infection, 
although many cases have as yet no clear-cut etiology. 
Diagnosis 
Fetal hydrocephalus is diagnosed sonographically, by the demonstration of abnormally dilated lateral cerebral 
ventricles. Certainly before 24 weeks and particularly in cases of associated spina bifida, the head circumference may 
be small rather than large for gestation. A transverse scan of the fetal head at the level of the cavum septum 
pellucidum will demonstrate the dilated lateral ventricles, defined by a diameter of 10 mm or more. The choroid 
plexuses, which normally fill the lateral ventricles are surrounded by fluid. A distinction is usually made between mild, 
or borderline, ventriculomegaly (diameter of the posterior horn 10-15 mm) and overt ventriculomegaly or 
hydrocephalus (diameter greater than 15 mm). 
Prognosis 
Fetal or perinatal death and neurodevelopment in survivors are strongly related to the presence of other 
malformations and chromosomal defects. Although mild, also referred to as borderline, ventriculomegaly is generally 
associated with a good prognosis, affected fetuses form the group with the highest incidence of chromosomal 
abnormalities (often trisomy 21). In addition in a few cases with apparently isolated mild ventriculomegaly there may 
be an underlying cerebral maldevelopment (such as lissencephaly) or destructive lesion (such as periventricular 
leukomalacia). Recent evidence suggests that in about 10% of cases there is mild to moderate neurodevelopmental 

delay. 
Fetaltherapy
There is some experimental evidence that in utero cerebrospinal fluid diversion may be beneficial. However, attempts 
in the 1980’s to treat hydrocephalic fetuses by ventriculo-amniotic shunting have now been abandoned because of 
poor results mainly because of inappropriate selection of patients. It is possible that intrauterine drainage may be 
beneficial if all intra-and extra-cerebral malformations and chromosomal defects are excluded, and if serial 
ultrasound scans demonstrate progressive ventriculomegaly. 
HOLOPROSENCEPHALY 
This is a spectrum of cerebral abnormalities resulting from incomplete cleavage of the forebrain. There are three 
types according to the degree of forebrain cleavage. The alobar type, which is the most severe, is characterized by a 
monoventricular cavity and fusion of the thalami. In the semilobar type there is partial segmentation of the ventricles 
and cerebral hemispheres posteriorly with incomplete fusion of the thalami. In lobar holoprosencephaly there is 
normal separation of the ventricles and thalami but absence of the septum pellucidum. The first two types are often 
accompanied by microcephaly and facial abnormalities. 
Prevalence 
Holoprosencephaly is found in about 1 per 10,000 births. 
Etiology 
Although in many cases the cause is a chromosomal abnormality (usually trisomy 13) or a genetic disorder with an 
autosomal dominant or recessive mode of transmission, in many cases the etiology is unknown. For sporadic, non-
chromosomal holoprosencephaly, the empirical recurrence risk is 6%. 
Diagnosis 
In the standard transverse view of the fetal head for measurement of the biparietal diameter there is a single dilated 
midline ventricle replacing the two lateral ventricles or partial segmentation of the ventricles. The alobar and 
semilobar types are often associated with facial defects, such as hypotelorism or cyclopia, facial cleft and nasal 
hypoplasia or proboscis 
Prognosis 
Alobar and semilobar holoprosencephaly are lethal. Lobar holoprosencephaly is associated with mental retardation. 
AGENESIS OF THE CORPUS CALLOSUM 
The corpus callosum is a bundle of fibers that connects the two cerebral hemispheres. It develops at 12-18 weeks of 
gestation. Agenesis of the corpus callosum may be either complete or partial (usually affecting the posterior part). 
Prevalence 
Agenesis of the corpus callosum is found in about 5 per 1,000 births. 

Etiology
Agenesis of the corpus callosum may be due to maldevelopment or secondary to a destructive lesion. It is commonly 
associated with chromosomal abnormalities (usually trisomies 18, 13 and 8) and more than 100 genetic syndromes. 
Diagnosis 
The corpus callosum is not visible in the standard transverse views of the brain but agenesis of the corpus callosum 
may be suspected by the absence of the cavum septum pellucidum and the ‘teardrop’ configuration of the lateral 
ventricles (enlargement of the posterior horns). Agenesis of the corpus callosum is demonstrated in the mid-coronal 
and mid-sagittal views, which may require vaginal sonography. 
Prognosis 
This depends on the underlying cause. In about 90% of those with apparently isolated agenesis of the corpus 
callosum development is normal. 
DANDY-WALKER COMPLEX 
The Dandy-Walker complex refers to a spectrum of abnormalities of the cerebellar vermis, cystic dilation of the fourth 
ventricle and enlargement of the cisterna magna. The condition is classified into (a) Dandy-Walker malformation 
(complete or partial agenesis of the cerebellar vermis and enlarged posterior fossa), (b) Dandy-Walker variant (partial 
agenesis of the cerebellar vermis without enlargement of the posterior fossa), and (c) mega-cisterna magna (normal 
vermis and fourth ventricle). 
Prevalence 
Dandy-Walker malformation is found in about 1 per 30,000 births. 
Etiology 
The Dandy-Walker complex is a non-specific end-point of chromosomal abnormalities (usually trisomy 18 or 13 and 
triploidy), more than 50 genetic syndromes, congenital infection or teratogens such as warfarin, but it can also be an 
isolated finding. 
Diagnosis 
Ultrasonographically, the contents of the posterior fossa are visualized through a transverse suboccipito-bregmatic 
section of the fetal head. In the Dandy-Walker malformation there is cystic dilatation of the fourth ventricle with 
partial or complete agenesis of the vermis; in more than 50% of the cases there is associated hydrocephalus and 
other extracranial defects. Enlarged cisterna magna is diagnosed if the vertical distance from the vermis to the inner 
border of the skull is more than 10 mm. 

Prenatal diagnosis of isolated partial agenesis of the vermis is difficult and a false diagnosis can be made prior to 18 
weeks gestation, when the formation of the vermis is incomplete and anytime in gestation if the angle of insonation is 
too steep. 
Prognosis 
Dandy-Walker malformation is associated with a high postnatal mortality (about 20%) and a high incidence (more 
than 50%) of impaired intellectual and neurological development. Experience with apparently isolated partial agenesis 
of the vermis or enlarged cisterna magna is limited and the prognosis for these conditions is uncertain. 
MICROCEPHALY 
Microcephaly means small head and brain. 
Prevalence 
Microcephaly is found in about 1 per 1,000 births. 
Etiology 
This may result from chromosomal and genetic abnormalities, fetal hypoxia, congenital infection, and exposure to 
radiation or other teratogens, such maternal anticoagulation with warfarin. It is commonly found in the presence of 
other brain abnormalities, such as encephalocele or holoprosencephaly. 
Diagnosis
The diagnosis is made by the demonstration of brain abnormalities, such as holoprosencephaly. In cases with 
apparently isolated microcephaly it is necessary to demonstrate progressive decrease in the head to abdomen 
circumference ratio to below the 1st centile with advancing gestation. Such diagnosis may not be apparent before the 

third trimester. In microcephaly there is a typical disproportion between the size of the skull and the face. The brain is 
small, with the cerebral hemispheres affected to a greater extent than the midbrain and posterior fossa. 
Prognosis 
This depends on the underlying cause, but in more than 50% of cases there is severe mental retardation. 
MEGALENCEPHALY 
Megalencephaly means large head and brain. 
Prevalence 
Megalencephaly is a very rare abnormality. 
Etiology 
This is usually familial with no adverse consequence. However, it may also be the consequence of genetic syndromes, 
such as Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome, achondroplasia, neurofibromatosis, and tuberous sclerosis. Unilateral 
megalencephaly is a sporadic condition. 
Diagnosis 
The diagnosis is made by the demonstration of a head to abdomen circumference ratio above the 99th centile without 
evidence of hydrocephalus or intracranial masses. Unilateral megalencephaly is characterized by macrocrania, a shift 
in the midline echo, borderline enlargement of the lateral ventricle and atypical gyri of the affected hemisphere. 

Prognosis 
Isolated megalencephaly is usually an asymptomatic condition. Unilateral megalencephaly is associated with severe 
mental retardation and untreatable seizures. 
DESTRUCTIVE CEREBRAL LESIONS 
These lesions include hydranencephaly, porencephaly and schizencephaly. In hydranencephaly there is absence of the 
cerebral hemispheres with preservation of the mid-brain and cerebellum. In porencephaly there are cystic cavities 
within the brain that usually communicate with the ventricular system, the subarachnoid space or both. 
Schizencephaly is associated with clefts in the fetal brain connecting the lateral ventricles with the subarachnoid 
space. 
Prevalence 
Destructive cerebral lesions are found in about 1 per 10,000 births. 
Etiology 
Hydranencephaly is a sporadic abnormality that may result from widespread vascular occlusion in the distribution of 
the internal carotid arteries, prolonged severe hydrocephalus, or an overwhelming infection such as toxoplasmosis or 
cytomegalovirus. Porencephaly may be caused by infarction of the cerebral arteries or hemorrhage into the brain 
parenchyma. Schizencephaly may be a primary disorder of brain development or it may be due to bilateral occlusion 
of the middle cerebral arteries. 
Diagnosis 
Complete absence of echoes from the anterior and middle fossae distinguishes hydranencephaly from severe 
hydrocephalus in which a thin rim of remaining cortex and the midline echo can always be identified. In porencephaly 
there is one or more cystic areas in the cerebral cortex, which usually communicates with the ventricle; the 
differential diagnosis is from intracranial cysts (arachnoid, glioependymal), that are usually found either within the 
scissurae or in the mid-line and compress the brain. In schizencephaly there are bilateral clefts extending from the 

lateral ventricles to the subarachnoid space, and is usually associated with absence of the cavum septum pellucidum. 
Prognosis
Hydranencephaly is usually incompatible with survival beyond early infancy. The prognosis in porencephaly is related 
to the size and location of the lesion and although there is increased risk of impaired neurodevelopment in some 
cases development is normal. Schizencephaly is associated with severe neurodevelopmental delay and seizures. 
ARACHNOID CYST 
Arachnoid cysts are fluid-filled cysts contained within the arachnoid space 
Prevalence 
Arachnoid cysts are extremely rare 
Etiology 
Unknown; infectious process has been hypothesized but it is unlikely that this may explain the congenital cysts 
Diagnosis 
Arachnoid cysts appear on antenatal ultrasound as sonolucent lesions with a thin regular outline, that do not contain 
blood flow, do not communicate with the lateral ventricles and anyhow are not associated with loss of brain tissue. 
They occur most frequently in the area of the cerebral fissure and in the midline. Large cysts may cause significant 
mass effect and the distinction from porencephaly may be difficult. Interhemispheric cysts associated with agenesis of 
the corpus callosum most likely are not arachnoid cysts, but rather glioependymal cysts. 
Arachnoid cyst (axial Plane) and Circle of Willis 
MRI showing the relation with the cerebral penducles 

Prognosis
Large cysts may cause intracranial hypertension and require neurosurgical treatment. However, a normal intellectual 
development in the range of 80-90% is reported by most series. Spontaneous remission has been described both in 
the postnatal as well as in the antenatal period. Glioependymal cysts, that should be suspected in those cases with 
associated agenesis of the corpus callosum probably reflect a greater degree of derangement in the development of 
the brain and this may be reflected in a worse outcome. 
CHOROID PLEXUS CYSTS 
These cysts, which are usually bilateral, are in the choroid plexuses of the lateral cerebral ventricles. 
Prevalence 
Choroid plexus cysts are found in about 2% of fetuses at 20 weeks of gestation but in more than 90% of cases they 
resolve by 26 weeks. 
Etiology 
The choroid plexus is easily visualized from 10 weeks of gestation when it occupies almost the entire hemisphere. 
Thereafter and until 26 weeks, there is a rapid decrease in both the size of the choroid plexus and of the lateral 
cerebral ventricle in relation to the hemisphere. Choroid plexus cysts contain cerebrospinal fluid and cellular debris. 
Diagnosis 
The diagnosis is made by the presence of single or multiple cystic areas (greater than 2 mm in diameter) in one or 
both choroid plexuses. 
Prognosis 
They are usually of no pathological significance, but they are associated with an increased risk for trisomy 18 and 
possibly trisomy 21. In the absence of other markers of trisomy 18 the maternal age-related risk is increased by a 
factor of 1.5. 
VEIN OF GALEN ANEURYSM 
This is a mid-line aneurismal dilation of the vein of Galen due to an arteriovenous malformation with major 
hemodynamic disturbances. 
Prevalence 
Vein of Galen aneurysm is a very rare abnormality. 
Etiology 
Vein of Galen aneurysm is a sporadic abnormality. 

Diagnosis
The diagnosis is made by the demonstration of a supratentorial mid-line translucent elongated cyst. Color Doppler 
demonstrates active arteriovenous flow within the cyst. There may be associated evidence of high-output heart 
failure. 
Prognosis 
In the neonatal period about 50% of the infants present with heart failure and the rest are asymptomatic. In later life 
hydrocephalus and intracranial hemorrhage may develop. Good results can be achieved by catheterization and 
embolization of the malformation.

Face 
NORMALSONOGRAPHICANATOMY 
The forehead, orbits, nose, lips and ears can be consistently identified from 12 weeks of gestation. Sagittal, 
transverse and coronal planes are all useful for the evaluation of normal and abnormal anatomy. A mid-sagittal plane 
allows visualization of the fetal profile, whereas the ears are visualized in parasagittal scans tangential to the 
calvarium. The coronal planes are probably the most important ones in the evaluation of the integrity of facial 
anatomy. Orbits, eyelids, nose, and lips are well visualized. The tip of the nose, the alae nasi, and the columna are 
seen above the upper lip. The nostrils typically appear as two little anechoic areas. 
A series of transverse scans from the top of the head moving caudally allows examination of the forehead, nasal 
bridge, orbits, nose, upper lip and anterior palate, the tongue within the oral cavity, lower lip and mandible. The 
presence and size of the eyes are assessed subjectively. As a rule of thumb, each orbital diameter is equal in size to 
the interorbital diameter. In cases of suspected defects measurement of the internal and external orbital diameters 
may be necessary. 

ORBITALDEFECTS
Hypertelorism(Euryopia) 
In early development the eyes are placed laterally in the primitive face in a fashion similar to that of lower animals 
with panoramic vision. As gestation progresses, they migrate toward the mid-line, creating favorable conditions for 
the development of stereoscopic vision. Hypertelorism is an increased interorbital distance and this can be either an 
isolated finding or associated with many clinical syndromes or malformations. The most common syndromes with 
hypertelorism are the median cleft syndrome (hypertelorism, median cleft lip with or without a median cleft of the 
hard palate and nose, and cranium bifidum occultum), craniosynostoses (including Apert, Crouzon, and Carpenter 
syndromes), agenesis of the corpus callosum and anterior encephaloceles. Hypertelorism per se results only in 
cosmetic problems and possible impairment of stereoscopic binocular vision. For severe cases, a number of operative 
procedures, such as canthoplasty, orbitoplasty, surgical positioning of the eyebrows, and rhinoplasty, have been 
proposed. The median cleft face syndrome is usually associated with normal intelligence and life span. However, there 
is a high likelihood of mental retardation when either extracephalic anomalies or an extreme degree of hypertelorism 
is found. The severity of the cosmetic disturbance should not be underestimated, because this syndrome may be 
associated with extremely grotesque features. 
Hypotelorism(stenopia) 
Hypotelorism (decreased interorbital distance) is almost always found in association with other severe anomalies, 
such as holoprosencephaly, trigonocephaly, microcephaly, Meckel syndrome, and chromosomal abnormalities. The 
prognosis, which depends on the associated anomalies, is usually very poor. 
Microphthalmia/anophthalmia 
Microphthalmia is defined as a decreased size of the eyeball and anophthalmia refers to the absence of the eye; 
however, the term anophthalmia should be reserved for the pathologist, who must demonstrate not only absence of 
the eye but also of optic nerves, chiasma, and tracts. Microphthalmia / anophthalmia, which is either unilateral or 
bilateral, is usually associated with with one of about 25 genetic syndromes. In Goldenhar syndrome (found in about 
1 per 5,000 births) there is unilateral anophthalmia, together with ear and facial abnormalities. Prenatal diagnosis is 
based on the demonstration of decreased ocular diameter and careful examination of the intraorbital anatomy is 
indicated to identify lens, pupil, and optic nerve. Congenital microphthalmia is frequently associated with visual 
disorders and with other anomalies. 

FACIALCLEFT 
This term refers to a wide spectrum of clefting defects (unilateral, bilateral and less commonly mid-line) usually 
involving the upper lip, the palate, or both. Cleft palate without cleft lip is a distinct disorder. Facial clefts encompass 
a broad spectrum of severity, ranging from minimal defects, such as a bifid uvula, linear indentation of the lip, or 
submucous cleft of the soft palate, to large deep defects of the facial bones and soft tissues. The typical cleft lip will 
appear as a linear defect extending from one side of the lip into the nostril. Cleft palate associated with cleft lip may 
extend through the alveolar ridge and hard palate, reaching the floor of the nasal cavity or even the floor of the orbit. 
Isolated cleft palate may include defects of the hard palate, the soft palate, or both. Both cleft lip and palate are 
unilateral in about 75% of cases and the left side is more often involved than the right side. 
Prevalence 
Facial clefting is found in about 1 per 800 births. In about 50% of cases both the lip and palate are defective, in 25% 
only the lip and in 25% only the palate is involved. 

Etiology 
The face is formed by the fusion of four outgrowths of mesenchyme (frontonasal, mandibular and paired maxillary 
swellings) and facial clefting is caused by failure of fusion of these swellings. Cleft lip with or without cleft palate is 
usually (more than 80% of cases) an isolated condition, but in 20% of cases it is associated with one of more than 
100 genetic syndromes. Isolated cleft palate is a different condition and it is more commonly associated with any one 
of more than 200 genetic syndromes. All forms of inheritance have been described, including autosomal dominant, 
autosomal recessive, X-linked dominant and X-linked recessive. Associated anomalies are found in about 50% of 
patients with isolated cleft palate and in about 15% of those with cleft lip and palate. Chromosomal abnormalities 
(mainly trisomy 13 and 18) are found in 1-2% of cases and exposure to teratogens (such as antiepileptic drugs) in 
about 5% of cases. Recurrences are type specific; if the index case has cleft lip and palate there is no increased risk 
for isolated cleft palate, and vice versa. Median cleft lip, which accounts for about 0.5% of all cases of cleft lip, is is 
usually associated with holoprosencephaly or the oral-facial-digital syndrome. 
Diagnosis 
The sonographic diagnosis of cleft and palate depends on demonstration of a groove extending from one of the 
nostrils inside the lip and possibly the alveolar ridge. Both transverse and coronal planes can be used. 
A transverse scan is required to distinguish isolated cleft lip from cleft lip/palate. 

BilateralCleftLipandPalate-3Dview(yellowarrow"flap") 
Median cleft lip is usually associated with other facial anomalies (hypertelorism with median cleft face syndrome, 
hypotelorism with holoprosencephaly). 
The diagnosis of isolated cleft palate is difficult and in cases at risk for Mendelian syndromes fetoscopy may be 
necessary. 
Prognosis 
Minimal defects, such as linear indentations of the lips or submucosal cleft of the soft palate, may not require surgical 
correction. Larger defects cause cosmetic, swallowing, and respiratory problems. Recent advances in surgical 
technique have produced good cosmetic and functional results. However, prognosis depends primarily on the 
presence and type of associated anomalies. 
MICROGNATHIA 
Micrognathia is characterized by mandibular hypoplasia causing a receding chin. 
Prevalence 
Micrognathia is found in about 1 per 1,000 births. 

Etiology 
Micrognathia is usually associated with genetic syndromes (such as Treacher-Collins, Robin and Robert syndromes), 
chromosomal abnormalities (mainly trisomy 18 and triploidy) and teratogenic drugs (such as methotrexate). The 
Robin anomalad (severe micrognathia, glossoptosis and a posterior cleft palate or an arched palate) may be a 
sporadic isolated finding (in about 40% of cases) or it may be associated with other anomalies or with recognized 
genetic and non-genetic syndromes. Otocephaly is a rare, lethal, sporadic abnormality characterized by severe 
hypoplasia of the mandible (agnathia) and severe midline defects, including holoprosencephaly, anterior 
encephalocele, cyclopia, aglossia, microstomia, and mid-facial location of the ears (‘ear-head’). 
Diagnosis 
Micrognathia is a subjective finding in the midsagittal view of the face and is characterized by a prominent upper lip 
and receding chin. The diagnosis can be confirmed by the demonstration of a short mandible. Severe micrognathia is 
associated with polyhydramnios possibly because of the glossoptosis preventing swallowing. 
Prognosis 
This depends on the presence of associated anomalies. Severe micrognathia can be a neonatal emergency due to 
airway obstruction by the tongue in the small oral cavity. If prenatal diagnosis is made a pediatrician should be 
present in the delivery room and be prepared to intubate the infant. Otocephaly is lethal.

Cardiovascular system 
INTRODUCTION TO CONGENITAL HEART DISEASE 
Abnormalities of the heart and great arteries are the most common congenital abnormalities. In general, about half 
are either lethal or require surgery and half are asymptomatic. The first two groups are referred to as major. 
Prevalence 
Cardiovascular abnormalities are found in 5-10 per 1,000 live births and in about 30 per 1,000 stillbirths. 
Etiology 
The etiology of heart defects is heterogeneous and probably depends on the interplay of multiple genetic and 
environmental factors, including maternal diabetes mellitus or collagen disease, exposure to drugs such as lithium, 
and viral infections such as rubella. Specific mutant gene defects and chromosomal abnormalities account for less 
than 5% of the patients. Heart defects are found in more than 90% of fetuses with trisomy 18 or 13, 50% of trisomy 
21, and 40% of those with Turner syndrome, deletions or partial trisomies involving a variety of chromosomes. 
Recurrence 
When a previous sibling has had a congenital heart defect, in the absence of a known genetic syndrome, the risk of 
recurrence is about 2%, and with two affected siblings the risk is 10%. When the father is affected, the risk for the 
offspring is about 2% and if the mother is affected the risk is about 10%. 
Reliability of prenatal diagnosis 
Echocardiography has been successfully applied to the prenatal assessment of the fetal cardiac function and structure, 
and has led to the diagnosis of most cardiac abnormalities. Studies from specialist centers report the diagnosis of 
about 90% of defects. However, the majority of such studies refer to the prenatal diagnosis of moderate to major 
defects in high-risk populations. 
Screening for cardiac abnormalities 
The main challenge in prenatal diagnosis is to identify the high-risk group for referral to specialist centers. The 
indications include congenital cardiac defects in one of the parents or previous pregnancies, maternal diabetes 
mellitus or ingestion of teratogenic drugs. However, more than 90% of fetuses with cardiac defects are from families 
without such risk factors. A higher sensitivity is achieved by examination of the four-chamber view of the heart at the 
routine 20-week scan; screening studies have reported the detection of about 30% of major cardiac defects. Recent 
evidence suggests that a higher sensitivity (more than 50%) can be achieved by referral for specialist 
echocardiography of patients with increased nuchal translucency at 10-14 weeks. 
ASSESSMENT OF THE FETAL HEART 
Real-time 2-dimensional evaluation 
The heart can be observed in an infinity of planes, but a few sections are the basis on which most of the diagnoses 
are made. These planes include the four-chamber, left and right chambers and great vessel views. Although it is 
convenient to refer to these standardized views for descriptive purposes, in practice it may be difficult to reproduce 
these exact sections, and the operator should be familiar with small variations of these planes. 

Complex cardiac anomalies are frequently associated with an abnormal disposition of the heart and extra-cardiac 
viscera. Fetal echocardiography should always include an assessment of topographic anatomy of the abdomen and 
chest. The left and right sides are assessed by determining the relative position of the head and spine. The visceral 
situs is then assessed by demonstrating the relative position of the stomach, hepatic vessels, abdominal aorta and 
inferior vena cava. 
The examination of the fetal heart begins with the assessment of the disposition of abdominal and thoracic organs, as 
an abnormal disposition is frequently associated with complex cardiac anomalies. A transverse section of the upper 
abdomen, the same used for the measurement of the abdominal circumference, allows to identify the position of the 
liver, stomach and great abdominal vessels. A transverse section of the thorax reveals the four-chamber view of the 
fetal heart. The heart occupies approximately one third of the thorax. The heart is not mid-line but shifted to the left 
side of the chest, with the apex pointing to the left. The axis of the interventricular septum is about 45º to 20º to the 
left of the anteroposterior axis of the fetus. 
Theexaminationofthefetalheartbeginswiththeassessmentofthedispositionofabdominalandthoracic 
organs 
In the four chamber view the normal ventricles, atria, atrio-ventricular valves, ventricular and atrial septae, foramen 
ovale flap, and pulmonary venous connections can be identified. The thickness of the interventricular septum and of 
the free ventricular walls is the same. The interatrial septum is open at the level of the foramen ovale. The foramen 
ovale flap is visible in the left atrium, beating toward the left side. The insertion of the tricuspid valve along the 
interventricular septum is more apical than the insertion of the mitral valve. The confluence of the pulmonary veins 
into the left atrium serves to identify it as such. Probably, about 90% of ultrasonographically detectable fetal cardiac 
defects demonstrate some abnormalities in this view. 

Normal CardiacAxis 
Evaluation of the cardiac outflow tracts can be difficult, and at present it is not considered a part of the standard 
examination of fetal anatomy. However, we believe that it is important to attempt such an examination because this 
improves the detection of many abnormalities of the heart and great arteries. The outflow tracts and great arteries 
can be demonstrated by slight angulations of the transducer from the four-chamber view. By turning the transducer 
while keeping the left ventricle and the aorta in the same plane, one can obtain the left heart views, while the right 
heart views are obtained by moving the transducer cranially and tilting slightly in the direction of the left shoulder. 
The left heart views demonstrate the left ventricle and aortic outflow tract. The anterior wall of the aorta is in 
continuity with the interventricular septum. 
The right heart views demonstrate the right ventricle and the right ventricular outflow tract. The main pulmonary 
artery originates from the anterior ventricle and trifurcates into a large vessel, the ductus going into the descending 
aorta, and two small vessels, the pulmonary arteries 
There are two arches in the fetus (aortic arch and curve of the ductus) and they should be distinguished. The 
brachiocephalic vessels originate from the aortic arch, while no vessels emanate from the ductus. Furthermore, the 
curve of the aortic arch is gentler than that of the ductus, which is slightly more angular. The cavae can be seen in a 
longitudinal view as they both enter the right atrium. 

M-Mode 
Heart rate and rhythm are assessed subjectively. M-mode, which is not used routinely, is useful for the evaluation of 
abnormal cases. In M-mode ultrasound, one line of information only is continuously displayed: instead of a two-
dimensional scan of the heart, a recording of the variations of echoes along a single line is produced. Thus, M-mode is 
of little help in the analysis of the morphology of the heart but is useful in assessing motions and rhythms. One 
simply “drops” an M-mode line over one atrial and ventricular wall and is able to quantify cardiac frequency, and to 
infer the atrioventricular sequence of contractions. 
Pulsed wave and color Doppler
Color Doppler overlays a representation of flow velocity over a conventional gray scale image. This allows a rapid 
recognition of the flow pattern. Color Doppler is useful to assess normal anatomy and physiology, valvular 
regurgitation or stenosis, shunting and the orientation of flows. Pulsed wave Doppler is used to analyze the spectral 
shift (to assess the resistance in a vessel), to obtain flow velocities (how the resistance affects the flow), and flow 
predictions (to estimate the perfusion). Pulsed Doppler ultrasound, in combination with two-dimensional and M-mode 
sonography, has proved useful in the evaluation of both fetal dysrhythmias and structural anomalies. Pulsed Doppler 
can be useful in the detection and assessment of severity of valvar abnormalities (stenosis, insufficiency). Analysis of 
atrioventricular inflows, hepatic veins and inferior vena cava can also be used to assess cardiac rhythm. 

ATRIAL SEPTAL DEFECTS 
Most atrial septal defects involve either the septum primum (the portion of the atrial septum below the foramen 
ovale) or the septum secundum (the portion above the foramen ovale). Primum atrial septal defect is the simplest 
form of the atrioventricular septal defects (see below). Secundum atrial septal defect, which are the most common, 
are usually isolated, but may be related to other cardiac lesions (such as mitral, pulmonary, tricuspid or aortic 
atresia) and are occasionally found as part of syndromes (including Holt-Oram syndrome in which there is hypo-
aplasia of the thumb and radius, triphalangeal thumb, abrachia, and phocomelia). 
Prevalence 
Secundum atrial septal defects, which represent about 10% of congenital heart defects, are found in about 1 per 
3,000 births. 
Diagnosis 
Although the in utero identification of secundum atrial septal defect has been reported, the diagnosis remains difficult 
because of the physiological presence of the foramen ovale and only unusually large defects can be recognized with 
certainty. 
Prognosis 
Atrial septal septal defects are not a cause of impairment of cardiac function in utero, as a large right-to-left shunt at 
the level of the atria is a physiological condition in the fetus. Most affected infants are asymptomatic even in the 
neonatal period. 
VENTRICULAR SEPTAL DEFECTS 
Defects in the ventricular septum are either isolated (about 50%) or they are part of a complex heart defect. They are 
classified into perimembranous, inlet, trabecular or outlet defects depending on their location on the septum. 

Perimembranous defects (80%) involve the membranous septum below the aortic valve, but also extend to variable 
degrees into the adjacent portion of the septum. The inlet defects are on the inflow tract of the right ventricle and 
thus affect the implantation of the septal chordae of the tricuspid valve. The trabecular defects occur in the muscular 
portion of the septum, and the outlet defects are in the infundibular portion of the right ventricle. 
Prevalence 
Ventricular septal defects, which represent 30% of all congenital heart defects, are found in about 2 per 1,000 births. 
Diagnosis 
Echocardiographic diagnosis depends on the demonstration of a dropout of echoes in the ventricular septum. Since 
most ventricular septal defects are perimembranous and subaortic, a detailed view of the left outflow tract is the best 
picture to image them. While evaluating the ventricular septum in search of defects, multiple views should be used. 
Overall, small isolated ventricular septal defects are difficult to detect prenatally, and both false positive and false 
negative diagnoses have been made. 
VentricularSeptalDefects 
In dubious cases, Color Doppler may be useful, in that many ventricular septal defects are associated with a 
demonstrable left to right shunt. 

Prognosis 
Ventricular septal defects are not associated with hemodynamic compromise in utero because the right and left 
ventricular pressures are very similar and the degree of shunting should be minimal. More than 90% of small defects 
close spontaneously within the first year of life. Large defects present with congestive heart failure at 2-8 weeks of 
life and require medical treatment (digoxin and diuretics). Rarely very large defects, associated with massive left to 
right shunt, can be associated with congestive heart failure soon after birth. If medical treatment fails surgical closure 
is undertaken; survival from surgery is more than 90% and survivors have a normal life expectancy and normal 
exercise tolerance. 
ATRIOVENTRICULAR SEPTAL DEFECTS 
The ontogenesis of the apical portion of the atrial septum, of the basal portion of the interventricular septum and of 
the atrioventricular valves depends on development of mesenchymal masses (endocardial cushions). Abnormal 
development of these structures is commonly referred to as endocardial cushion defects, atrioventricular canal or 
atrioventricular septal defects. In the complete form, persistent common atrioventricular canal, the tricuspid and 
mitral valve are fused in a large single atrioventricular valve that opens above and bridges the two ventricles. In the 
complete form of atrioventricular canal, the common atrioventricular valve may be incompetent, and systolic blood 
regurgitation from the ventricles to the atria may give rise to congestive heart failure. 
Prevalence 
Atrioventricular septal defects, which represent about 7% of all congenital heart defects, are found in about 1 per 
3,000 births. 

Diagnosis 
Antenatal echocardiographic diagnosis of complete atrioventricular septal defects is usually easy. An obvious 
deficiency of the central core structures of the heart is present. Color Doppler ultrasound can be useful, in that it 
facilitates the visualization of the central opening of the single atrioventricular valve. The atria may be dilated as a 
consequence of atrioventricular insufficiency. In such cases, Color and pulsed Doppler ultrasound allow one to identify 
the regurgitant jet. 
The incomplete forms are more difficult to recognize. The main clue is the absence of the atrial septum below the 
level of the foramen ovalis. Another useful hint is the demonstration that the tricuspid and mitral valves attach at the 
same level at the crest of the septum. This apical displacement of the mitral valve elongates the left ventricular 
outflow tract. The atrial septal defect is of the ostium primum type (since the septum secundum is not affected) and 
thus is close to the crest of the interventricular septum. 
Prognosis 
Atrioventricular septal defects will usually be encountered either in fetuses with chromosomal aberrations (50% of 
cases are associated with aneuploidy, 60% being trisomy 21, 25% trisomy 18) or in fetuses with cardiosplenic 
syndromes. In the former cases, an atrioventricular septal defect is frequently found in association with extra-cardiac 
anomalies. In the latter cases, multiple cardiac anomalies and abnormal disposition of the abdominal organs are 
almost the rule. 
Atrioventricular septal defects do not impair the fetal circulation per se. However, the presence of atrioventricular 
valve insufficiency may lead to intrauterine heart failure. The prognosis of atrioventricular septal defects is poor when 
detected in utero, probably because of the high frequency of associated anomalies in antenatal series. About 50% of 
untreated infants die within the first year of life from heart failure, arrhythmias and pulmonary hypertention due to 
right-to-left shunting (Eisenmenger syndrome). Survival after surgical closure (which is usually carried out in the sixth 
month of life) is more than 90% but in about 10% of patients a second operation for atrioventricular valve repair or 
replacement is necessary. Long-term prognosis is good. 

UNIVENTRICULAR HEART 
This term defines a group of anomalies characterized by the presence of an atrioventricular junction that is entirely 
connected to only one chamber in the ventricular mass. Therefore, univentricular heart includes both those cases in 
which two atrial chambers are connected, by either two distinct atrioventricular valves or by a common one, to a main 
ventricular chamber (double-inlet single ventricle) as well as those cases in which, because of the absence of one 
atrioventricular connection (tricuspid or mitral atresia), one of the ventricular chambers is either rudimentary or 
absent. 
Prevalence 
Univentricular heart is rare; it represents about 1.5% of all congenital cardiac defects. 
Diagnosis 
In double-inlet single ventricle, two separate atrioventricular valves are seen opening into a single ventricular cavity 
without evidence of the interventricular septum. In mitral / tricuspid atresia, there is only one atrioventricular valve 
connected to a main ventricular chamber. A small rudimentary ventricular chamber lacking of atrioventricular 
connection is a frequent but not constant finding. Demonstration of two patent great arteries arising from the 
ventricle allows a differential diagnosis from hypoplastic ventricles (hypoplastic left heart syndrome, pulmonary 
atresia with intact ventricular septum). 
Prognosis 
Surgical treatment (the Fontan procedure) involves separation of the systemic circulations by anastomosing the 
superior and inferior vena cava directly to the pulmonary artery. The survivors from this procedure often have long-
term complications including arrhythmias, thrombus formation and protein-losing enteropathy. The 5-year survival is 
about 70%. 
AORTIC STENOSIS 
Aortic stenosis is commonly divided in supravalvar, valvar and subaortic forms. Supravalvar aortic stenosis can be 
due to one of three anatomic defects: a membrane (usually placed above the sinuses of Valsalva), a localized 
narrowing of the ascending aorta (hourglass deformity) or a diffuse narrowing involving the aortic arch and branching 
arteries (tubular variety). The valvar form of aortic stenosis can be due to dysplastic, thickened aortic cusps or fusion 
of the commissure between the cusps. The subaortic forms include a fixed type, representing the consequence of a 
fibrous or fibromuscular obstruction, and a dynamic type, which is due to a thickened ventricular septum obstructing 
the outflow tract of the left ventricle. The latter is also known as asymmetric septal hypertrophy or idiopathic 
hypertrophic subaortic stenosis. A transient form of dynamic obstruction of the left outflow tract is seen in infants of 
diabetic mothers, and is probably the consequence of fetal hyperglycemia and hyperinsulinemia. 
Prevalence 
Aortic stenosis, which represents 3% of all congenital heart defects, is found in about 1 per 7,000 births. 

Diagnosis 
Most cases of mild to moderate aortic stenosis are probably not amenable to early prenatal diagnosis. Severe valvar 
aortic stenosis of the fetus is usually associated with a hypertrophic left ventricle. Less frequently, a dilated and 
poorly contracting left ventricle is found. 
Within the ascending aorta (that can be small or enlarged) pulsed Doppler demonstrates increased peak velocity 
(usually in excess of 1 m/sec). At the Color Doppler examination, high velocity and turbulence results in aliasing, with 
a mosaic of colors. 
Severe aortic stenosis may result in atrioventricular valve insufficiency and intrauterine heart failure. Asymmetric 
septal hypertrophy and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy of fetuses of diabetic mothers resulting in subaortic stenosis has 
been occasionally diagnosed by demonstrating an unusual thickness of the ventricular septum. We are not aware of 
cases of supravalvular aortic stenosis detected in utero. 
Prognosis 
Depending upon the severity of the aortic stenosis, the association of left ventricular pressure overload and 
subendocardial ischemia, due to decrease in coronary perfusion, may lead to intrauterine impairment of cardiac 
function. Subvalvular and subaortic forms are not generally manifested in the neonatal period. Conversely, the valvar 
type can be a cause of congestive heart failure in the newborn and fetus as well. Although there is concern that cases 
seen in early gestation may progress in severity, the lesion usually remains stable. The neonatal outcome depends on 
the severity of obstruction. If the left ventricular function is adequate balloon valvuloplasty is carried out in the 
neonatal period and in about 50% of cases surgery is necessary within the first 10 years of life because of aortic 
insufficiency or residual stenosis. If left ventricular function is inadequate a Norwood-type of repair is necessary (see 
hypoplastic left heart). 

Fetal therapy 
Antenatal transventricular balloon valvuloplasty has been attempted in a handful of cases but the results are 
uncertain. 
COARCTATION AND TUBULAR HYPOPLASIA OF THE AORTA 
Coarctation is a localized narrowing of the juxtaductal arch, most commonly between the left subclavian artery and 
the ductus. Cardiac anomalies are present in 90% of the cases and include aortic stenosis and insufficiency, 
ventricular septal defect, atrial septal defect, transposition of the great arteries, truncus and double outlet right 
ventricle. Non-cardiac anomalies include diaphragmatic hernia, Turner syndrome but not Noonan syndrome. 
Diagnosis 
Coarctation may be a postnatal event, and this limits prenatal diagnosis in many cases. It should be suspected when 
the right ventricle is enlarged (right ventricle to left ventricle ratio of more than 1.3). Narrowing of the isthmus, or the 
presence of a shelf are often difficult to demonstrate because in the fetus aortic arch and ductal arch are close and 
are difficult to distinguish. In most cases, coarctation can only be suspected in utero and a certain diagnosis must be 
delayed until after birth. 
Prognosis 
Critical coarctation is fatal in the neonatal period after closure of the ductus and therefore prostaglandin therapy is 
necessary to maintain a patent ductus. Surgery (which involves excision of the narrowed segment and end-to-end 
anastomosis) is associated with a mortality of about 10% and the incidence of restenosis in survivors (requiring 
further surgical repair) is about 15%. 
INTERRUPTED AORTIC ARCH 
The interruption of the aortic arch can be complete or there may be an atretic fibrous segment between the arch and 
the descending aorta. It may be isolated or associated with intracardiac lesions that cause obstruction to the blood 
flow from the left heart (aortic stenosis, aortic atresia, malaligned ventricular septal defects). Associated extracardiac 
anomalies are frequent and include DiGeorge syndrome (association of thymic aplasia, type B interruption and 
hypoplastic mandible), holoprosencephaly, cleft lip/palate, esophageal atresia, duplicated stomach, diaphragmatic 
hernia, horseshoe kidneys, bilateral renal agenesis, oligodactyly, claw hand and syrenomelia. 
Diagnosis 
Interrupted aortic arch should always be considered when intracardiac lesions diverting blood flow from the left to the 
right heart are encountered (aortic stenosis and atresia in particular). Isolated interruption of the aortic arch is often 
encountered with enlargement of the right ventricle (right ventricle to left ventricle ratio of more than 1.3). As the 
sonographic access to the arch is difficult, the diagnosis is not always possible. The characteristic finding of an 
ascending aorta more vertical than usually, and the impossibility to demonstrate a connection with the descending 
aorta suggest the diagnosis. 

Prognosis 
The median age at death for unoperated infants is four days. The initial treatment is the same as for any anomalies in 
which the perfusion is ductus dependent: prostaglandin E1. Recent reports suggest an overall late survival of more 
than 70% after surgery. 
HYPOPLASTIC LEFT HEART SYNDROME 
This is a spectrum of anomalies characterized by a very small left ventricle with mitral and/or aortic atresia or 
hypoplasia. Blood flow to the head and neck vessels and coronary artery is supplied in a retrograde manner via the 
ductus arteriosus. 
Diagnosis 
Prenatal echocardiographic diagnosis of the syndrome depends on the demonstration of a diminutive left ventricle and 
ascending aorta. In most cases, the ultrasound appearance is self-explanatory, and the diagnosis an easy one. There 
is however a broad spectrum of hypoplasia of the left ventricle and in some cases the ventricular cavity is almost 
normal in size. As the four-chamber view is almost normal, we anticipate that these cases will be certainly missed in 
most routine surveys of fetal anatomy. At a closer scrutiny, however, the movement of the mitral valve appears 
severely impaired to non-existent, ventricular contractility is obviously decreased, and the ventricle often displays an 
internal echogenic lining that is probably due to endocardial fibroelastosis. 

The definitive diagnosis of the syndrome depends on the demonstration of hypoplasia of the ascending aorta and 
atresia of the aortic valve. Color flow mapping is an extremely useful adjunct to the real-time examination, in that it 
allows the demonstration of absent to severely decreased mitral valve flow and of retrograde blood flow within the 
ascending aorta and aortic arch. 
Prognosis 
Hypoplastic left heart is well tolerated in utero. The patency of the ductus arteriosus allows adequate perfusion of the 
head and neck vessels. Intrauterine growth may be normal, and the onset of symptoms most frequently occurs after 
birth. The prognosis for infants with hypoplastic left heart syndrome is extremely poor and this lesion is responsible 
for 25 % of cardiac deaths in the first week of life. Almost all affected infants die within six weeks if they are not 
treated. In the neonatal period prostaglandin therapy is given to maintain ductal patency but still congestive heart 
failure develops within 24 hours of life. Options for surgery include cardiac transplantation in the neonatal period 
(with an 80% 5-year survival) and the three-staged Norwood repair. Stage 1 involves anastomosis of the pulmonary 
artery to the aortic arch for systemic outflow, placement of systemic-to-pulmonary arterial shunt to provide 
pulmonary blood flow, and arterial septectomy to ensure unobstructed pulmonary venous return; the mortality from 
the procedure is about 30%. Stage 2 (which is usually carried out in the sixth month of life) involves anastomosis of 
the superior vena cava to the pulmonary arteries. The overall 2-year survival with the Norwood repair is about 50% 
but more than 50% of survivors have neurodevelopmental delay. 
PULMONARY STENOSIS AND PULMONARY ATRESIA 
Prevalence 
Pulmonary stenosis is found in about 1 per 2,000 births. Pulmonary atresia is rare, and is found in less than 1 per 
10,000 births. 

Diagnosis 
The most common form of pulmonary stenosis is the valvar type, due to the fusion of the pulmonary leaflets. 
Hemodynamic is altered proportionally to the degree of the stenosis. The work of the right ventricle is increased, as 
well as the pressure, leading to hypertrophy of the ventricular walls. The same considerations formulated for the 
prenatal diagnosis of aortic stenosis are valid for pulmonic stenosis as well. A handful of cases recognized in utero 
have been reported in the literature thus far, mostly severe types with enlargement of the right ventricle and/or post-
stenotic enlargement or hypoplasia of the pulmonary artery. 
Pulmonary atresia with intact ventricular septum (PA:IVS) in infants is usually associated with an hypoplastic right 
ventricle. However, cases with enlarged right ventricle and atrium have been described with unusual frequency in 
prenatal series. Although these series are small, it is possible that the discrepancy with the pediatric literature is due 
to the very high perinatal loss rate that is found in "dilated" cases. Enlargement of the ventricle and atrium is 
probably the consequence of tricuspid insufficiency. Prenatal diagnosis of PA:IVS relies on the demonstration of a 
small pulmonary artery with an atretic pulmonary valve. The considerations previously formulated for the diagnosis of 
hypoplastic left heart syndrome apply to PA:IVS as well. 

Prognosis 
Patients with mild stenosis are asymptomatic and there is no need for intervention. Patients with severe stenosis, 
right ventricular overload may result in congestive heart failure and require balloon valvuloplasty in the neonatal 
period with excellent survival and normal long-term prognosis. Fetuses with pulmonary atresia and an enlarged right 
heart have a very high degree of perinatal mortality. Infants with right ventricular hypoplasia require biventricular 
surgical repair and the mortality is about 40%. 
EBSTEIN’S ANOMALY AND TRICUSPID VALVE DYSPLASIA 
Ebstein's anomaly results from a faulty implantation of the tricuspid valve. The posterior and septal leaflets are 
elongated and tethered below their normal level of attachment on the annulus or displaced apically, away from the 
annulus, down to the junction between the inlet and trabecular portion of the right ventricle. The anterior leaflet is 
normally inserted but deformed. The resulting configuration is that of a considerably enlarged right atrium at the 
expense of the right ventricle. The portion of the right ventricle that is ceded to the right atrium is called the atrialized 
inlet of the right ventricle. It has a thin wall that may even be membranous and is commonly dilated. The tricuspid 
valve is usually both incompetent and stenotic. Associated anomalies include atrial septal defect, pulmonary atresia, 
ventricular septal defect, and supraventricular tachycardia. Ebstein's may be associated with trisomy 13, 21, Turner, 
Cornelia de Lange and Marfan syndromes. Maternal ingestion of lithium has also been incriminated as a causal factor. 
Diagnosis 
The characteristic finding is that of a massively enlarged right atrium, a small right ventricle, and a small pulmonary 
artery. Doppler can be used to demonstrate regurgitation in the right atrium. About 25% of the cases have 
supraventricular tachycardia (from re-entrant impulse), atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter. Differential diagnosis from 
pulmonary atresia with intact ventricular septum and a regurgitant tricuspid valve or isolated tricuspid valve 
insufficiency is difficult and may be impossible antenatally. 
Prognosis 
Although the disease has a variable severity with some cases discovered only late in life, Ebstein's anomalies detected 
prenatally have a dismal prognosis, with essentially all patients dying. This probably reflects that the prenatal variety 
is more severe than the one detected in children or adults. 

CONOTRUNCAL MALFORMATIONS 
Conotruncal malformations are a heterogeneous group of defects that involve two different segments of the heart: 
the conotruncus and the ventricles. Conotruncal anomalies are relatively frequent. They account for 20-30% of all 
cardiac anomalies and are the leading cause of symptomatic cyanotic heart disease in the first year of life. Prenatal 
diagnosis is of interest for several reasons. Given the parallel model of fetal circulation, conotruncal anomalies are 
well tolerated in utero. The clinical presentation occurs usually hours to days after delivery, and is often severe, 
representing a true emergency and leading to considerable morbidity and mortality. Yet, these malformations have a 
good prognosis when promptly treated. Two ventricles of adequate size and two great vessels are commonly present 
giving the premise for biventricular surgical correction. The outcome is indeed much more favorable than with most of 
the other cardiac defects that are detected antenatally. The first reports on prenatal echocardiography of conotruncal 
malformations date back from the beginning of the ‘80s. Nevertheless, despite improvement in the technology of 
diagnostic ultrasound, the recognition of these anomalies remains difficult. The four-chamber view is frequently 
unremarkable in these cases. A specific diagnosis requires meticulous scanning and at times may represent a 
challenge even for experienced sonologists. Referral centers with special expertise in fetal echocardiography have 
indeed reported both false positive and false negative diagnoses. There is a typical association between conotruncal 
anomalies and 22q11 deletion, a condition associated with long term implications, including immune deficits, 
neurological development and speech, that may not be apparent in neonatal life. 
TRANSPOSITION OF THE GREAT ARTERIES 
Transposition of the great arteries is an abnormality in which the aorta arises entirely or in large part from the right 
ventricle and the pulmonary artery arises from the left ventricle. Associated cardiac lesions are present in about 50% 
of cases, including ventricular septal defects (which can occur anywhere in the ventricular septum), pulmonary 
stenosis, unbalanced ventricular size ("complex transpositions"), anomalies of the mitral valve, which can be 
straddling or overriding. There are three types of complete transposition: those with intact ventricular septum with or 
without pulmonary stenosis, those with ventricular septal defects and those with ventricular septal defect and 
pulmonary stenosis. 
Prevalence 
Transposition of the great arteries is found in about 1 per 5,000 births. 
Diagnosis 
Complete transposition is probably one of the most difficult cardiac lesions to recognize in utero. In most cases the 
four-chamber view is normal, and the cardiac cavities and the vessels have normal appearance. A clue to the 
diagnosis is the demonstration that the two great vessels do not cross but arise parallel from the base of the heart. 
The most useful echocardiographic view however is the left heart view demonstrating that the vessel connected to the 
left ventricle has a posterior course and bifurcates into the two pulmonary arteries. Conversely, the vessel connected 
to the right ventricle has a long upward course and gives rise to the brachio-cephalic vessels. 

Difficulties may arise in the case of huge malalignment ventricular septal defect with overriding of the posterior 
semilunar root. This combination makes the differentiation with double outlet right ventricle very difficult. Corrected 
transposition is characterized by a double discordance, at the atrio-ventricular and ventriculo-arterial level. The left 
atrium is connected to the right ventricle, which is in turn connected to the ascending aorta. Conversely, the right 
atrium is connected with the right ventricle, which is in turn connected to the ascending aorta. The derangement of 
the conduction tissue secondary to malalignment of the atrial and ventricular septa may result in dysrhythmias, 
namely complete atrioventricular block. For diagnostic purposes, the identification of the peculiar difference of 
ventricular morphology (moderator band, papillary muscles, insertion of the atrioventricular valves) has a prominent 
role. Demonstration that the pulmonary veins are connected to an atrium which is in turn connected with a ventricle 
that has the moderator band at the apex is an important clue, that is furthermore potentially identifiable even in a 
simple four-chamber view. Diagnosis requires meticulous scanning to carefully assess all cardiac connections, by 
using the same views described for the complete form. The presence of atrioventricular block increases the index of 
suspicion. 
Prognosis 
As anticipated from the parallel model of fetal circulation, complete transposition is uneventful in utero. After birth, 
survival depends on the amount and size of the mixing of the two otherwise independent circulations. Patients with 
transposition and an intact ventricular septum present shortly after birth with cyanosis and deteriorate rapidly. When 
a large ventricular septal defect is present, cyanosis can be mild. Clinical presentation may be delayed up to 2-4 
weeks, and usually occurs with signs of congestive heart failure. When severe stenosis of the pulmonary artery is 
associated with a ventricular septal defect, symptoms are similar to patients with tetralogy of Fallot. The time and 
mode of clinical presentation with corrected transposition depend upon the concomitant cardiac defects. 
Surgery (which involves arterial switch to establish anatomic and physiological correction) is usually carried out within 
the first two weeks of life. Operative mortality is about 10% and 10-year follow-up studies report normal function but 
there is uncertainty if in the long term such patients are at increased risk of atherosclerotic coronary disease. In cases 
with pulmonary stenosis and ventricular septal defect balloon atrial septostomy may be necessary to ensure adequate 
oxygenation until definitive repair when the patient is older. 
TETRALOGY OF FALLOT 
The essential features of this malformation are: (a) malalignment ventricular septal defect with anterior displacement 
of the infundibular septum associated with subpulmonary narrowing and overriding aortic root and (b) demonstrable 
continuity between the right outflow tract and the pulmonary trunk. In about 20% of cases this continuity is lacking 
leading to atresia of the pulmonary valve, a condition that is commonly referred to as pulmonary atresia with 
ventricular septal defect. Tetralogy of Fallot can be associated with other specific cardiac malformations, defining 
peculiar entities. These include atrioventricular septal defects (found in 4% of cases), and absence of the pulmonary 
valve, (found in less than 2% of cases). Hypertrophy of the right ventricle, one of the classic elements of the tetrad, 
is always absent in the fetus, and only develops after birth. 
Prevalence 
Tetralogy of Fallot is found in about 1 per 3,000 births. 

Diagnosis 
Echocardiographic diagnosis of tetralogy of Fallot relies on the demonstration of a ventricular septal defect in the 
outlet portion of the septum and an overriding aorta. There is an inverse relationship between the size of the 
ascending aorta and pulmonary artery, with a disproportion that is often striking. A large aortic root is indeed an 
important diagnostic clue. 
Doppler studies provide valuable information. The finding of increased peak velocities in the pulmonary artery 
corroborates the diagnosis of Tetralogy of Fallot by suggesting obstruction to blood flow in the right outflow tract. 
Conversely, demonstration with color and/or pulsed Doppler that, in the pulmonary artery, there is either no forward 
flow or reverse flow allows a diagnosis of pulmonary atresia. Diagnostic problems arise at the extremes of the 
spectrum of tetralogy of Fallot. In cases with minor forms of right outflow obstruction and aortic overriding 
differentiation from a simple ventricular septal defect can be difficult. In those cases in which the pulmonary artery is 
not imaged, a differential diagnosis between pulmonary atresia with ventricular septal defect and truncus arteriosus 
communis is similarly difficult. The sonographer should also be alerted to a frequent artifact that resembles overriding 
of the aorta. Incorrect orientation of the transducer may demonstrate apparent septo-aortic discontinuity in a normal 
fetus. The mechanism of the artifact is probably related to the angle of incidence of the sound beam. Careful 
visualization of the left outflow tract with different insonation angles, as well as the use of color Doppler and the 
research of the other elements of the tetralogy, should virtually eliminate this problem. Abnormal enlargement of the 
right ventricle, main pulmonary trunk and artery, suggests absence of pulmonary valve. Evaluation of other variables, 
such as multiple ventricular septal defects and coronary anomalies, would be valuable for a better prediction of 
surgical timing and operative prognosis. Unfortunately, these findings cannot be recognized for certain by prenatal 
echocardiography. 
Prognosis 
Cardiac failure is never seen in fetal life as well as postnatally. Even in cases of tight pulmonary stenosis or atresia, 
the wide ventricular septal defect provides adequate combined ventricular output, while the pulmonary vascular bed 
is supplied in a retrograde manner by the ductus. The only exception to this rule is represented by cases with an 
absent pulmonary valve that may result in massive regurgitation to the right ventricle and atrium. When severe 
pulmonic stenosis is present, cyanosis tends to develop immediately after birth. With lesser degrees of obstruction to 
pulmonary blood flow the onset of cyanosis may not appear until later in the first year of life. When there is 
pulmonary atresia, rapid and severe deterioration follows ductal constriction. Survival after complete surgical repair 
(which is usually carried out in the third month of life) is more than 90% and about 80% of survivors have normal 
exercise tolerance. 
DOUBLE-OUTLET RIGHT VENTRICLE 
In double-outlet right ventricle (DORV) most of the aorta and pulmonary valve arise completely or almost completely 
from the right ventricle. The relation between the two vessels may vary, ranging from a Fallot-like to a TGA-like 
situation (the Taussig-Bing anomaly). DORV is not a single malformation from a pathophysiological point of view. The 
term refers only to the position of the great vessels that is found in association with ventricular septal defects, 
tetralogy of Fallot, transposition, univentricular hearts. Pulmonary stenosis is very common in all types of DORV, but 
left outflow obstructions, from subaortic stenosis to coarctation and interruption of the aortic arch, can also be seen. 

Prevalence 
Double-outlet right ventricle is found in less than 1 per 10,000 births. 
Diagnosis 
Prenatal diagnosis of DORV can be reliably made in the fetus but differentiation from other conotruncal anomalies can 
be very difficult, especially with Tetralogy of Fallot and transposition of the great arteries with ventricular septal 
defect. The main echocardiographic features include (a) alignment of the two vessels totally or predominantly from 
the right ventricle and (b) presence in most cases of bilateral coni (subaortic and subpulmonary). 
Prognosis 
The hemodynamic are dependent upon the anatomic type of DORV and the associated anomalies. Since the fetal 
heart works as a common chamber where the blood is mixed and pumped, DORV is not associated with intrauterine 
heart failure. However DORV, in contrast to other conotruncal malformations, is commonly associated with 
extracardiac anomalies and/or chromosomal defects. The early operative mortality is about 10%. 
TRUNCUS ARTERIOSUS COMMUNIS 
Truncus arteriosus is characterized by a single arterial vessel that originates from the heart, overrides the ventricular 
septum and supplies the systemic, pulmonary and coronary circulations. The single arterial trunk is larger than the 
normal aortic root and is predominantly connected with the right ventricle in about 40% of cases, with the left 
ventricle in 20%, and is equally shared in 40%. The truncal valve may have one, two or three cusps and is rarely 
normal. It can be stenotic or, more frequently, insufficient. A malalignment ventricular septal defect, usually wide, is 
an essential part of the malformation. There are three types based on the morphology of the pulmonary artery. In 
type 1, the pulmonary arteries arise from the truncus within a short distance from the valve, as a main pulmonary 
trunk, which then bifurcates. In type 2, there is no main pulmonary trunk. In type 3, only one pulmonary artery 
(usually the right) originates from the truncus, while the other is supplied by a systemic collateral vessel from the 
descending aorta. Eventually, type 4 is characterized by an interruption of the aortic arch. Similar to tetralogy of 
Fallot, and unlike the other conotruncal malformations, truncus is frequently (about 30%) associated with 
extracardiac malformations. 

Prevalence 
Truncus arteriosus is found in about 1 per 10,000 births. 
Diagnosis 
Truncus arteriosus can be reliably detected with fetal echocardiography. The main diagnostic criteria are: 
(a) a single semilunar valve overrides the ventricular septal defect 
(b) there is direct continuity between one or two pulmonary arteries and the single arterial trunk. 
The semilunar valve is often thickened and moves abnormally. Doppler ultrasound is of value to assess incompetence 
of the truncal valve. A peculiar problem found in prenatal echocardiography is the demonstration of the absence of 
pulmonary outflow tract and the concomitant failure to image the pulmonary arteries. In this situations a 
differentiation between truncus and pulmonary atresia with ventricular septal defect may be impossible. 
Prognosis 
Similar to the other conotruncal anomalies truncus arteriosus is not associated with alteration of fetal hemodynamics. 
Truncus arteriosus is frequently a neonatal emergency. These patients have usually unobstructed pulmonary blood 
flow and show signs of progressive congestive heart failure with the postnatal fall in pulmonary resistance. Many 
patients will present with cardiac failure in the fist 1 or 2 weeks of life. Surgical repair (usually before the sixth month 
of life) involves closure of the ventricular septal defect and creation of a conduit connection between the right 
ventricle and the pulmonary arteries. Survival from surgery is about 90% but the patients require repeated surgery 
for replacement of the conduit. 
CARDIOSPLENIC SYNDROMES 
In cardiosplenic syndromes, also referred to as heterotaxy, the fetus is made of either two left or two right sides. 
Other terms commonly used include left or right isomerism, asplenia and polysplenia. Unpaired organs (liver, stomach 
and spleen) may be absent, midline or duplicated. Because of left atrial isomerism (thus absence of right atrium 
which is the normal location for the pacemaker) and abnormal atrioventricular junctions, atrioventricular blocks are 
very common. Cardiosplenic syndromes are typically associated with abnormal situs, that is abnormal disposition of 

abdominal and/or thoracic organs. 
Prevalence 
Cardiosplenic syndromes, which represent about 2% of all congenital heart defects, are found in about 1 in 10,000 
births. 
POLYSPLENIA 
In polysplenia, the fetus has two left sides (one in normal position and the other as a mirror image); this is called left 
isomerism. Multiple small spleens (usually too small to be detected by antenatal ultrasound) are found posterior to 
the stomach. The liver is midline and symmetric. But the stomach and aorta can be on opposite sides. Cardiac 
anomalies are almost invariably present, including anomalous pulmonary venous return, atrioventricular canal, and 
obstructive lesions of the aortic valve. One typical and peculiar finding is the interruption of the inferior vena cava, 
with the lower portion of the body drained by the azygos vein. 
Evaluation of the disposition of the abdominal organs is of special value for the sonographic diagnosis of fetal 
cardiosplenic syndromes. In normal fetuses, a transverse section of the abdomen demonstrates the aorta on the left 
side and the inferior vena cava on the right; the stomach is to left and the portal sinus of the liver bends to the right, 
towards the gallbladder. In polysplenia, a typical finding is interruption of the inferior vena cava with azygous 
continuation (there is failure to visualize the inferior vena cava and a large venous vessel, the azygos vein, runs to 
the left and close to the spine and ascends into the upper thorax). Symmetry of the liver can be sonographically 
recognized in utero by the abnormal course of the portal circulation that does not display a clearly defined portal sinus 
bending to the right. 
The heterogeneous cardiac anomalies found in association with polysplenia are usually easily seen, but a detailed 
diagnosis often poses a challenge; in particular, assessment of connection between the pulmonary veins and the 
atrium (an element that has a major prognostic influence) can be extremely difficult. Associated anomalies include 
absence of the gallbladder, malrotation of the guts, duodenal atresia and hydrops. 

ASPLENIA 
In asplenia, the fetus has two right sides (right isomerism). As in polysplenia, evaluation of the disposition of the 
abdominal organs is a major clue to the diagnosis. The liver is generally midline and the stomach right-or left-sided. 
The aorta and cava are on the same side (either left or right) of the spine. The spleen cannot be seen and the 
stomach is found in close contact with the thoracic wall. Cardiac malformations are severe, with a tendency towards a 
single structure replacing normal paired structures: single atrium, single atrioventricular valve, single ventricle and 
single great vessel, and are usually easily demonstrated. 
Diagnosis 
Cardiosplenic syndromes may be inferred by the abnormal disposition of the abdominal organs. The presence of 
complex cardiac abnormalities is almost the rule. 
Prognosis 
The outcome depends on the amount of cardiac anomalies, but it tends to be poor. Atrioventricular insufficiency and 
severe fetal bradycardia due to atrioventricular block may lead to intrauterine heart failure. 
ECHOGENIC FOCI 
Prevalence 
Echogenic foci in the heart are found in about 4% of pregnancies and in 12% of fetuses with trisomy 21. 
Etiology 
Histological studies have shown these foci to be due to mineralization within a papillary muscle. 
Diagnosis 
Echogenic foci are detected in the four-chamber view of the heart. In about 95% of cases they are located in the left 
ventricle and in 5% in the right ventricle; in 98% they are unilateral and 2% bilateral. Ventricular function is normal 
and the atrioventricular valves are competent. 
Four-chamberview.Notethewhitearrowpointingtheechogenicfociintheleftventricule. 
Prognosis 
Echogenic foci are usually of no pathological significance and in more than 90% of cases they resolve by the third 
trimester or during pregnancy. However they are sometimes associated with cardiac defects and chromosomal 
abnormalities. For isolated hyperechogenic foci the risk for trisomy 21 may be three-times the background maternal 
age and gestation related risk. 

CARDIAC DYSRHYTHMIAS: PREMATURE CONTRACTIONS 
Ectopic heart beats are common but they are abnormal only when they occur at a frequency of more than 1 in 10 
beats. Premature contractions may be of atrial (much more common) or ventricular origin. Immaturity of the 
conducting system may be the origin. The diagnosis is made by passing an M-mode cursor through one atrium and 
one ventricle. Premature atrial contractions are spaced closer to the previous contraction than normally and may be 
transmitted to the ventricle or blocked. 
Premature ventricular contractions present in the same way but are not accompanied by an atrial contraction. 
Premature ventricular contractions are often followed by a compensatory pause due to the refractory state of the 
conduction system; the next conducted impulse arrives at twice the normal interval, and the continuity of the rhythm 
is not broken. Premature atrial contractions are usually followed by a non-compensatory pause; when the regular 
rhythm resumes, it is not synchronous with the rhythm before the extrasystole. The distance between the contraction 
that preceded the premature contraction and the one following it is not twice the distance between two normal 
contractions but a little shorter. Another approach to the sonographic diagnosis is to evaluate the waveforms obtained 
from the atrioventricular valves, hepatic vessels or inferior vena cava, which demonstrate pulsations corresponding to 
atrial and ventricular contractions. 
Premature contractions are benign, tend to disappear spontaneously in utero, and only rarely persist after birth. It 
has been suggested that in some cases there may be progression to tachyarrhythmia, but the risk if any is certainly 
very small. 
CARDIAC DYSRHYTHMIAS: TACHYARRHYTHMIAS 
Tachyarrhythmias are classified according to the origin and the number of beats per minute. In the majority of cases 
the abnormal electrical impulse originates from the atria. Atrial tachyarrhythmia includes supraventricular 
tachycardia, atrial flutter and atrial fibrillation. Since atrial rhythms greater than 240 bpm are usually associated with 
varying degrees of atrioventricular block, the ventricular rate is usually reduced to 60 to 160 bpm. Ventricular 
tachycardia has been occasionally encountered during fetal life. Supraventricular tachycardia is the most common 
form of tachyarrhythmia, and the ventricular response is 1:1. It is characterized by a heart rate of 200-300 bpm. 
Supraventricular tachycardia may be due to an autonomous focus, in which case the rhythm is monotonous, or to a 
re-entry mechanism, in which case sudden conversion from an abnormal to a normal rhythm can be seen. Cardiac 
malformations are rare. 

Atrial flutter is associated with a heart rate 300-400 bpm. The ventricular response is equal to or less than 2:1. 
Occasionally, atrioventricular block of high degree with ventricular bradycardia are seen. Structural anomalies are 
more common than in supraventricular tachycardia and include Ebstein's anomaly and pulmonic stenosis. 
Atrial fibrillation is characterized by an atrial rate greater than 400 bpm and completely irregular ventricular 
rhythm, with constant variation of the distance between systole. The atrial contractions are usually too small to be 
detected by M-mode. A combination of different atrial arrhythmias may coexist in the same fetus. 
Ventricular tachycardias are rare, and have typically a ventricular frequency of 200 bpm or less. Associated 
anomalies include atrial septal defect, atrial septal aneurysm, mitral anomalies, endocardial cushion defect, 
endocardial fibroelastosis, Ebstein's anomaly, cardiac tumors (rhabdomyoma), anomalies of the conduction system, 
Coxsackie B infection and cardiomyopathy. Tachycardia is commonly associated with hydrops, as a consequence of 
low cardiac output. 
Diagnosis 
The heart rate, atrial and ventricular, can be analyzed by either M-mode sonography of the cardiac chambers or 
pulsed Doppler evaluation of atrioventricular inflows, hepatic veins and inferior vena cava. A heart rate of about 240 
bpm with atrioventricular conduction of 1:1, is pathognomonic of supraventricular tachycardia. An atrial rate greater 
than 300 bpm with an atrioventricular response of 1:2 or less indicates atrial flutter. A very fast atrial rate with 
irregular ventricular response is indicative of atrial fibrillation. A ventricular rate in the range of 200 bpm with a 
normal atrial rate is suggestive of ventricular tachycardia. 
Prognosis 
Sustained tachycardia is associated with suboptimal ventricular filling and decreased cardiac output. This results in 
atrial overload and congestive failure. Fetuses with supraventricular tachycardia that occasionally convert to sinus 
rhythm can tolerate well the condition. Sustained tachycardias of greater than 200 bpm frequently result in fetal 

hydrops. The combination of hydrops and dysrrhythmia has a poor prognosis (mortality of 80%) independently of the 
nature of the tachycardia. 
Fetal therapy 
After 32 weeks of gestation the fetus should be delivered and treated ex utero. Prenatal treatment is the standard of 
care for premature fetuses that have sustained tachycardias of more than 200 bpm, particularly if there is associated 
hydrops and/or polyhydramnios. The treatment depends on the type of tachycardia, and the aim is to either decrease 
the excitability or increase the conduction time to block a re-entrant mechanism. Although a vagual maneuver (such 
as simple compression of the cord) may sometimes suffice, the administration of antiarrhythmic drugs is often 
necessary. The drugs used include propranolol, verapamil, procainamide, quinidine, flecainide, amiodarone and 
adenosine; combination of these drugs is also possible but the optimal approach remains uncertain. These drugs are 
usually administered to the mother but they can also be given directly to the fetus (intraperitoneally, intramuscularly 
in the thigh or intravascular through the umbilical cord). The usual response to treatment is conversion to a normal 
rhythm, followed by shorter episodes of tachycardia that are more interspersed, and finally the presence of 
extrasystole alone. Fetuses with normal rhythm but persistent hydrops are still at risk of death. The survival rate of 
fetuses with tachyarrhythmias treated in utero is more than 90%. 
CARDIAC DYSRHYTHMIAS: COMPLETE ATRIOVENTRICULAR BLOCK 
In complete atrioventricular block, the atria beat at their own rhythm, and none of their impulses is transmitted to the 
ventricles. The ventricles have a slow rate (40-70 bpm). 
In 50% of cases structural anomalies are present (mostly left isomerism and corrected transposition of the great 
arteries). In the remaining cases, the condition is almost exclusively caused by the presence of maternal 
autoantibodies anti-Ro (SS-a) or anti-La (SS-B). Most mothers are asymptomatic but in a few cases connective tissue 
disease is present (lupus erythematosus, scleroderma, rheumatoid arthritis and Sjogren's syndrome). Fetuses with 
cardiac malformations have heart block starting from the first trimester. Atrioventricular block secondary to maternal 
autoantibodies develops slowly throughout gestation; a normal cardiac rhythm may be found in the second trimester. 
Atrial and ventricular contractions are identified by either M-mode or pulsed Doppler, as previously described. The 
prognosis depends on the presence of cardiac defects, the ventricular rate and the presence of hydrops; usually, 
fetuses with a ventricular rate greater than 55 bpm have a normal intrauterine growth and do not develop heart 
failure. Conversely, hydrops is almost the rule for greater degrees of ventricular bradycardia. Intrauterine treatment 
by the administration of beta-mimetic agents has been used (with the aim of increasing electric excitability of the 
myocardial cells and thus ventricular rate), but the results have been disappointing. Maternal administration of 
steroids (Dexamethasone 8 mg/day) has been advocated for complete heart block secondary to maternal 
autoantibodies, but the value of this treatment remains, however, unproven. Invasive fetal cardiac pacing has been 
attempted but thus far there have been no survivors.

Pulmonary abnormalities 
NORMAL SONOGRAPHIC ANATOMY 
For the purpose an an ultrasound survey of fetal anatomy, examination of the lungs in the same section used for the 
four-chamber view of the fetal heart is sufficient. Under normal condition, the fetal lungs are uniformely echogenic. At 
18-23 weeks, the central third of the thoracic area at the level of the four chamber view is occupied by the heart, and 
the remaining two thirds by the lungs, that are normally uniformely echogenic. This scanning plane can also be used 
for the measurement of the thoracic circumference, that is correlated with the development of the lungs. 
A sagittal plane of the fetal trunk usually allows one to identify the diaphragm as a thin sonolucent line separating the 
abdominal from the thoracic cavity. 
CYSTIC ADENOMATOID MALFORMATION (CAM) 
Cystic adenomatoid malformation of the lung is a developmental abnormality arising from an overgrowth of the 
terminal respiratory bronchioles. The condition may be bilateral involving all lung tissue, but in the majority of cases it 
is confined to a single lung or lobe. The lesions are either macrocystic (cysts of at least 5 mm in diameter) or 
microcystic (cysts less than 5 mm in diameter). In 85% of cases, the lesion is unilateral with equal frequency in the 
right and left lungs and equal frequency in the microcystic and macrocystic types. 
Prevalence 
Cystic adenomatoid malformation of the lung is found in about 1 in 4000 births. 
Etiology 
This is a sporadic abnormality. In about 10% of cases, there are other abnormalities, mainly cardiac and renal. 
Diagnosis 
Prenatal diagnosis is based on the ultrasonographic demonstration of a hyperechogenic pulmonary tumor which is 
cystic (CAM type 1), mixed (CAM type 2), or solid – microcystic (CAM type 3). Microcystic disease results in uniform 
hyperechogenicity of the affected lung tissue. In macrocystic disease, single or multiple cystic spaces may be seen 
within the thorax. Both microcystic and macrocystic disease may be associated with deviation of the mediastinum. 

When there is compression of the heart and major blood vessels in the thorax, fetal hydrops develops. 
Polyhydramnios is a common feature and this may be a consequence of decreased fetal swallowing of amniotic fluid 
due to esophageal compression, or increased fluid production by the abnormal lung tissue. Prognostic features for 
poor outcome include major lung compression causing pulmonary hypoplasia, polyhydramnios and development of 
hydrops fetalis irrespective of the type of the lesion. 
Prognosis 
Bilateral disease is lethal either in utero, due to progressive hydrops, or in the neonatal period. Isolated unilateral 
cystic adenomatoid malformation without hydrops is associated with a good prognosis; in about 70% of cases, the 
relative size of the fetal tumor remains stable, in 20% of cases there is antenatal shrinkage or resolution, and in 10% 
of cases there is progressive increase in mediastinal compression. In symptomatic neonates, thoracotomy and 
lobectomy are carried out and survival is about 90%. It is uncertain whether surgery is also needed for asymptomatic 
neonates. 
Fetaltherapy 
Large intrathoracic cysts causing major mediastinal shift and associated hydrops can be treated effectively by the 
insertion of thoraco-amniotic shunts. The role of more invasive intervention, such as hysterotomy and excision of 
solid tumors in cases of fetal hydrops, remains to be defined. Although good results have been reported after such 
surgery in a small number of cases, the potential risks to the mother both during the pregnancy and in subsequent 
confinements should not be underestimated. 
DIAPHRAGMATIC HERNIA 
Development of the diaphragm is usually completed by the 9th week of gestation. In the presence of a defective 
diaphragm, there is herniation of the abdominal viscera into the thorax at about 10–12 weeks, when the intestines 
return to the abdominal cavity from the umbilical cord. However, at least in some cases, intrathoracic herniation of 
viscera may be delayed until the second or third trimester of pregnancy. 
Prevalence 
Diaphragmatic hernia is found in about 1 per 4000 births. 
Etiology 
Diaphragmatic hernia is usually a sporadic abnormality. However, in about 50% of affected fetuses there are 
associated chromosomal abnormalities (mainly trisomy 18, trisomy 13 and Pallister–Killian syndrome – mosaicism for 
tetrasomy 12p), other defects (mainly craniospinal defects, including spina bifida, hydrocephaly and the otherwise 
rare iniencephaly, and cardiac abnormalities) and genetic syndromes (such as Fryns syndrome, de Lange syndrome 
and Marfan syndrome). 
Diagnosis 
Prenatally, the diaphragm is imaged by ultrasonography as an echo-free space between the thorax and abdomen. 
Diaphragmatic hernia can be diagnosed by the ultrasonographic demonstration of stomach and intestines (90% of the 
cases) or liver (50%) in the thorax and the associated mediastinal shift to the opposite side. Herniated abdominal 

contents, associated with a left-sided diaphragmatic hernia, are easy to demonstrate because the echo-free fluid-filled 
stomach and small bowel contrast dramatically with the more echogenic fetal lung. In contrast, a right-sided hernia is 
more difficult to identify because the echogenicity of the fetal liver is similar to that of the lung, and visualization of 
the gall bladder in the right side of the fetal chest may be the only way of making the diagnosis. 
Polyhydramnios (usually after 25 weeks) is found in about 75% of cases and this may be the consequence of impaired 
fetal swallowing due to compression of the esophagus by the herniated abdominal organs. The main differential 
diagnosis is from cystic lung disease, such as cystic adenomatoid malformation or mediastinal cystic processes, e.g. 
neuroenteric cysts, bronchogenic cysts and thymic cysts. In these cases, a fluid-filled structure causing mediastinal 
shift may be present within the chest. However, in contrast to diaphragmatic hernia, the upper abdominal anatomy is 
normal. 
Antenatal prediction of pulmonary hypoplasia remains one of the challenges of prenatal diagnosis because this would 
be vital in both counselling parents and also in selecting those cases that may benefit from prenatal surgery. Poor 
prognostic signs are, first, increased nuchal translucency thickness at 10–14 weeks, second, intrathoracic herniation 
of abdominal viscera before 20 weeks, and, third, severe mediastinal compression suggested by an abnormal ratio in 
the size of the cardiac ventricles and the development of polyhydramnios. 
Prognosis 
In the human, the bronchial tree is fully developed by the 16th week of gestation, at which time the full adult number 
of airways is established. The alveoli continue to develop even after birth, increasing in number and size until the 
growth of the chest wall is completed in adulthood. The growth of blood vessels supplying the acinus (intra-acinar 
vessels) parallels alveolar development, while the growth of pre-acinar vessels follows the development of the 
airways. In diaphragmatic hernia, the reduced thoracic space available to the developing lung leads to reduction in 
airways, alveoli and arteries. Furthermore, there is an increase in arterial medial wall thickness and extension of 
muscle peripherally into the small pre-acinar arteries, offering an explanation for the pulmonary hypertension and 
persistent fetal circulation observed after neonatal repair. Thus, although isolated diaphragmatic hernia is an 
anatomically simple defect, which is easily correctable, the mortality rate is about 50%. The main cause of death is 
hypoxemia due to pulmonary hypertension, resulting from the abnormal development of the pulmonary vascular bed. 
Fetaltherapy 
Extensive animal studies have suggested that pulmonary hypoplasia and hypertension due to intrathoracic 
compression are reversible by in utero surgical repair. However, such therapy is likely to have limited success in the 
human because the bronchial tree is fully developed by the 16th week of gestation. For a fetus with a sonographically 
demonstrable large diaphragmatic hernia at 16–18 weeks, irreversible maldevelopment of the bronchial tree and 
vasculature is likely. However, in fetuses with a diaphragmatic defect which allows the intrathoracic herniation of 
abdominal viscera only after mid-gestation (when the bronchial tree and pre-acinar vessels are fully developed), 
prenatal correction, by allowing further development of the alveoli and intra-acinar vessels, may well prevent 
pulmonary hypoplasia and neonatal death. In a few cases of diaphragmatic hernia, hysterotomy and fetal surgery 
have been carried out but this intervention has now be abandoned in favor of minimally invasive surgery. Animal 
studies have demonstrated that obstruction of the trachea results in expansion of the fetal lungs by retained 
pulmonary secretions. Endoscopic occlusion of the fetal trachea has also been carried out in human fetuses with 
diaphragmatic hernia, but the number of cases is too small for useful conclusions to be drawn as to the effectiveness 
of such treatment. 

PLEURAL EFFUSIONS 
Fetal pleural effusions, which may be unilateral or bilateral, may be an isolated finding or they occur in association 
with generalized edema and ascites. 
Prognosis 
Irrespective of the underlying cause, infants affected by pleural effusions usually present in the neonatal period with 
severe, and often fatal, respiratory insufficiency. This is either a direct result of pulmonary compression caused by the 
effusions, or due to pulmonary hypoplasia secondary to chronic intrathoracic compression. The overall mortality of 
neonates with pleural effusions is 25%, with a range from 15% in infants with isolated pleural effusions to 95% in 
those with gross hydrops. The mortality rate in cases of antenatally diagnosed chylothorax is about 50%. Isolated 
pleural effusions in the fetus may either resolve spontaneously or they can be treated effectively after birth. 
Nevertheless, in some cases, severe and chronic compression of the fetal lungs can result in pulmonary hypoplasia 
and neonatal death. In others, mediastinal compression leads to the development of hydrops and polyhydramnios, 
which are associated with a high risk of premature delivery and perinatal death. 
Fetaltherapy 
Attempts at prenatal therapy by repeated thoracocenteses for drainage of pleural effusions have been generally 
unsuccessful in reversing the hydropic state, because the fluid reaccumulates within 24–48 h of drainage. A better 
approach is chronic drainage by the insertion of thoracoamniotic shunts. This is useful both for diagnosis and 
treatment. First, the diagnosis of an underlying cardiac abnormality or other intrathoracic lesion may become 
apparent only after effective decompression and return of the mediastinum to its normal position. Second, it can 
reverse fetal hydrops, resolve polyhydramnios and thereby reduce the risk of preterm delivery, and may prevent 
pulmonary hypoplasia. Third, it may be useful in the prenatal diagnosis of pulmonary hypoplasia because, in such 
cases, the lungs often fail to expand after shunting. Furthermore, it may help to distinguish between hydrops due to 
primary accumulation of pleural effusions, in which case the ascites and skin edema may resolve after shunting, and 
other causes of hydrops such as infection, in which drainage of the effusions does not prevent worsening of the 
hydrops. Survival after thoracoamniotic shunting is more than 90% in fetuses with isolated pleural effusions and 
about 50% in those with hydrops. 
SEQUESTRATION OF THE LUNGS 
In lung sequestration, a portion of the lung develops without connection to the airways. The blood supply to the 
abnormal lung tissue is through arteries that arise from the descending aorta rather than from the pulmonary artery. 
This condition is classically divided in the radiological literature into intralobar (about 75%) and extralobar (about 
25%), but the difference (which is based on the presence or absence of a separate pleural covering from the normal 
lung) cannot be accurately determined with prenatal ultrasound. 
Prevalence 
Sequestration of the lungs is rare and the prevalence is less than 5% of congenital pulmonary abnormalities. 

Etiology 
Sequestration of the lungs is a sporadic abnormality. 
Diagnosis 
The sequestrated portion of the lung appears as a homogeneous, brightly echogenic mass in the lower lobes of the 
lungs or in the upper abdomen (infradiaphragmatic sequestration). The diagnosis is confirmed by color Doppler 
demonstration that the vascular supply of the sequestered lobe arises from the abdominal aorta. 
Large lung sequestration may act as an arteriovenous fistula and cause high-output heart failure and hydrops. 
Intralobar sequestrations are usually isolated, whereas more than 50% of extralobar sequestrations are associated 
with other abnormalities (mainly diaphragmatic hernia and cardiac defects). 
Prognosis 
Postnatal outcome depends on the presence of associated abnormalities, and hemodynamic disturbances. In general, 
intralobar sequestration has an excellent prognosis, whereas extralobar sequestration has a poor prognosis because 
of the high incidence of other defects and hydrops.

Anterior abdominal wall 
NORMAL SONOGRAPHIC ANATOMY 
Normal development of the anterior abdominal wall depends on the fusion of four ectomesodermic folds (cephalic, 
caudal and two lateral). At 8–10 weeks of gestation, all fetuses demonstrate herniation of the mid-gut that is 
visualized as a hyperechogenic mass in the base of the umbilical cord; retraction into the abdominal cavity occurs at 
10–12 weeks and is completed by 11 weeks and 5 days. The integrity of the abdominal wall should always be 
demonstrated; this can be achieved by transverse scans demonstrating the insertion of the umbilical cord. It is also 
important to visualize the urinary bladder within the fetal pelvis, because this rules out exstrophy of the bladder and 
of the cloaca. 
EXOMPHALOS 
Exomphalos results from failure of normal embryonic regression of the mid-gut from the umbilical stalk into the 
abdominal celom. The abdominal contents, including intestines and liver or spleen covered by a sac of parietal 
peritoneum and amnion, are herniated into the base of the umbilical cord. 
Less often there is an associated failure in the cephalic embryonic fold, resulting in the pentalogy of Cantrell (upper 
mid-line omphalocele, anterior diaphragmatic hernia, sternal cleft, ectopia cordis and intracardiac defects) or failure of 
the caudal fold, in which case the omphalocele may be associated with exstrophy of the bladder or cloaca, 
imperforate anus, colonic atresia and sacral vertebral defects. The Beckwith–Wiedemann syndrome (usually sporadic 
and occasionally familial syndrome with a birth prevalence of about 1 in 14 000) is the association of omphalocele, 
macrosomia, organomegaly and macroglossia; in some cases there is mental handicap, which is thought to be 

secondary to inadequately treated hypoglycemia. About 5% of affected individuals develop tumors during childhood, 
most commonly nephroblastoma and hepatoblastoma. 
Prevalence 
Exomphalos is found in about 1 per 4000 births. 
Etiology 
The majority of cases are sporadic and the recurrence risk is usually less than 1%. However, in some cases, there 
may be an associated genetic syndrome. Chromosomal abnormalities (mainly trisomy 18 or 13) are found in about 
50% of cases at 12 weeks, 30% of cases at mid-gestation and in 15% of neonates. Similarly, in Beckwith– 
Wiedemann syndrome, most cases are sporadic, although autosomal dominant, recessive, X-linked and polygenic 
patterns of inheritance have been described. 
Diagnosis 
The diagnosis of exomphalos is based on the demonstration of the mid-line anterior abdominal wall defect, the 
herniated sac with its visceral contents and the umbilical cord insertion at the apex of the sac. Ultrasonographic 
examination should be directed towards defining the extent of the lesion and exclusion of other malformations. 
Prognosis 
Exomphalos is a correctable malformation in which survival depends primarily on whether or not other malformations 
or chromosomal defects are present. For isolated lesions, the survival rate after surgery is about 90%. The mortality 
is much higher with cephalic fold defects than with lateral and caudal defects. 
GASTROSCHISIS 
In gastroschisis, the primary body folds and the umbilical ring develop normally and evisceration of the intestine 
occurs through a small abdominal wall defect located just lateral and usually to the right of an intact umbilical cord. 
The loops of intestine lie uncovered in the amniotic fluid and become thickened, edematous and matted. 

Prevalence 
Gastroschisis is found in about 1 per 4000 births. 
Etiology 
This is a sporadic abnormality. Associated chromosomal abnormalities are rare, and, although other malformations 
are found in 10–30% of the cases, these are mainly gut atresias, probably due to gut strangulation and infarction in 
utero. 
Diagnosis 
Prenatal diagnosis is based on the demonstration of the normally situated umbilicus and the herniated loops of 
intestine, which are free-floating and widely separated, and usually on the right of the cord insertion. In the 
midtrimester, the bowel loops are uniformely echogenic. 
In the thrid trimester, chemical peritonitis causes distension and thickening of the walls of the intesttine. 
About 30% of fetuses are growth-restricted but the diagnosis can be difficult because gastroschisis as such is 
associated with a small abdominal circumference. 
Prognosis 
Postoperative survival is about 90%; mortality is usually the consequence of short gut syndrome. In this condition, 
the infants require total parenteral nutrition and they usually die within the first 4 years of life from liver disease. 
BODY STALK ANOMALY 
This abnormality is characterized by the presence of a major abdominal wall defect, severe kyphoscoliosis and a 
rudimentary umbilical cord. 

Prevalence 
Body stalk anomaly is found in about 1 per 10 000 pregnancies. 
Etiology 
This is a sporadic abnormality. The pathogenesis is uncertain but possible causes include abnormal folding of the 
trilaminar embryo during the first 4 weeks of development, early amnion rupture with amniotic band syndrome, and 
early generalized compromise of embryonic blood flow. 
Diagnosis 
The ultrasonographic features are a major abdominal wall defect, severe kyphoscoliosis and a short or absent 
umbilical cord. Typically, the liver is directly attached to the placenta without an interposed umbilical cord and there is 
major distortion of the spine. 
In the first trimester, it is possible to demonstrate that part of the fetal body is in the amniotic cavity and the other 
part is in the celomic cavity. The findings suggest that early amnion rupture before obliteration of the celomic cavity is 
a possible cause of the syndrome. 
Prognosis 
This is a lethal abnormality. 
BLADDER EXSTROPHY AND CLOACAL EXSTROPHY 
Bladder exstrophy is a defect of the caudal fold of the anterior abdominal wall; a small defect may cause epispadias 
alone, whilst a large defect leads to exposure of the posterior bladder wall. In cloacal exstrophy, both the urinary and 
gastrointestinal tracts are involved. Cloacal exstrophy (also referred to as OEIS complex) is the association of an 
omphalocele, exstrophy of the bladder, imperforated anus, and spinal defects such as meningomyelocele. The 
hemibladders are on either side of the intestines. 
Prevalence 
Bladder exstrophy is found in 1 per 30 000 births and cloacal exstrophy is found in about 1 in per 200 000 births. 
Etiology 
Both bladder exstrophy and cloacal exstrophy are sporadic abnormalities. 
Diagnosis 
Bladder exstrophy should be suspected when, in the presence of normal amniotic fluid, the fetal bladder is not 
visualized (the filling cycle of the bladder is normally in the range of 15 min); an echogenic mass is seen protruding 
from the lower abdominal wall, in close association with the umbilical arteries.

green arrows: everted bladder; blue arrows the scrotum; yellow arrows: umbilcal cord 
In cloacal exstrophy, the findings are similar to bladder exstrophy (large infraumbilical defect that extends to the 
pelvis), but a posterior anomalous component (represented by herniated bowel and/or a meningomyelocele) is 
present. Other findings include single umbilical artery, ascites, vertebral anomalies, club foot and ambiguous genitalia 
(in boys, the penis is divided and duplicated). 

Prognosis 
With aggresive reconstructive bladder, bowel and genital surgery, survival is more than 80%. Although it has been 
suggested that gender re-assignment to females should occur, psychological follow-ups of such patients suggest that 
both male and females with this condition are capable of a normal lifestyle with normal intelligence, although some 
form of urinary tract diversion is required for all. Furthermore, both sexes have been reported to be fertile after 
surgery.

Chapter7 
Gastrointestinaltract 
NORMALSONOGRAPHICANATOMY 
Sonographically, the fetal stomach is visible from 9 weeks of gestation as a sonolucent cystic structure in the upper 
left quadrant of the abdomen. The bowel is normally uniformly echogenic until the third trimester of pregnancy, when 
prominent meconium-filled loops of large bowel are commonly seen. The liver comprises most of the upper abdomen 
and the left lobe is greater in size than the right due to its greater supply of oxygenated blood. The gall bladder is 
seen as an ovoid cystic structure to the right and below the intrahepatic portion of the umbilical vein. The spleen may 
also be visualized in a transverse plane posterior and to the left of the fetal stomach. The abdominal circumference 
should be measured in a cross-section of the abdomen demonstrating the stomach and portal sinus of the liver. The 
visceral situs should be assessed, by demonstrating the relative position of the stomach, hepatic vessels, abdominal 
aorta and inferior vena cava. 
ESOPHAGEALATRESIA 
Esophageal atresia and tracheoesophageal fistulae, found in about 90% of cases, result from failure of the primitive 
foregut to divide into the anterior trachea and posterior esophagus, which normally occurs during the 4th week of 
gestation. 
Prevalence 
Esophageal atresia is found in about 1 in 3000 births. 
Etiology 
Esophageal atresia and tracheoesophageal fistulae are sporadic abnormalities. Chromosomal abnormalities (mainly 
trisomy 18 or 21) are found in about 20% of fetuses. Other major defects, mainly cardiac, are found in about 50% of 
the cases. Tracheoesophageal fistulae may be seen as part of the VATER association (vertebral and ventricular septal 
defects, anal atresia, tracheoesophageal fistula, renal anomalies, radial dysplasia and single umbilical artery). In over 
80% of cases, esophageal atresia occurs in association with a tracheo-esophageal fistula, allowing intake of amniotic 
fluid from the stomach, that may be therefore normally distended, particularly in early gestation. 

Diagnosis 
Prenatally, the diagnosis of esophageal atresia is suspected when, in the presence of polyhydramnios (usually after 25 
weeks), repeated ultrasonographic examinations fail to demonstrate the fetal stomach. 
However, gastric secretions may be sufficient to distend the stomach and make it visible. If there is an associated 
fistula, the stomach may look normal. Occasionally (after 25 weeks), the dilated proximal esophageal pouch can be 
seen as an elongated upper mediastinal and retrocardiac anechoic structure. This is a dynamic finding, however, that 
occurs only at the time of fetal swallowing, and requires therefore prolonged sonographic visualization. 
The differential diagnosis for the combination of absent stomach and polyhydramnios includes intrathoracic 
compression, by conditions such as diaphragmatic hernia, and muscular-skeletal anomalies causing inability of the 
fetus to swallow. 

Prognosis 
Survival is primarily dependent on gestation at delivery and the presence of other anomalies. Thus, for babies with an 
isolated tracheoesophageal fistula, born after 32 weeks, when an early diagnosis is made, avoiding reflux and 
aspiration pneumonitis, postoperative survival is more than 95%. 
DUODENALATRESIA 
At 5 weeks of embryonic life, the lumen of the duodenum is obliterated by proliferating epithelium. The patency of the 
lumen is usually restored by the 11th week and failure of vacuolization may lead to stenosis or atresia. Duodenal 
obstruction can also be caused by compression from the surrounding annular pancreas or by peritoneal fibrous bands. 
Prevalence 
Duodenal atresia is found in about 1 per 5000 births. 
Etiology 
Duodenal atresia is a sporadic abnormality, although, in some cases, there is an autosomal recessive pattern of 
inheritance. Approximately half of fetuses with duodenal atresia have associated abnormalities, including trisomy 21 
(in about 40% of fetuses) and skeletal defects (vertebral and rib anomalies, sacral agenesis, radial abnormalities and 
talipes), gastrointestinal abnormalities (esophageal atresia/tracheoesophageal fistula, intestinal malrotation, Meckel’s 
diverticulum and anorectal atresia), cardiac and renal defects. 
Diagnosis 
Prenatal diagnosis is based on the demonstration of the characteristic ‘double bubble’ appearance of the dilated 
stomach and proximal duodenum, commonly associated with polyhydramnios. 
However, obstruction due to a central web may result in only a ‘single bubble’, representing the fluid-filled stomach. 
Continuity of the duodenum with the stomach should be demonstrated to differentiate a distended duodenum from 
other cystic masses, including choledochal or hepatic cysts. Although the characteristic ‘double bubble’ can be seen as 
early as 20 weeks, it is usually not diagnosed until after 25 weeks, suggesting that the fetus is unable to swallow a 
sufficient volume of amniotic fluid for bowel dilatation to occur before the end of the second trimester of pregnancy. 
Prognosis 
Survival after surgery in cases with isolated duodenal atresia is more than 95%. 
INTESTINALOBSTRUCTION 
Intestinal obstructions are either intrinsic or extrinsic. Intrinsic lesions result from absent (atresia) or partial 
(stenosis) recanalization of the intestine. In cases of atresia, the two segments of the gut may be either completely 
separated or connected by a fibrous cord. In cases of stenosis, the lumen of the gut is narrowed or the two intestinal 

segments are separated by a septum with a central diaphragm. Apple-peel atresia is characterized by absence of a 
vast segment of the small bowel, which can include distal duodenum, the entire jejunum and proximal ileus. Extrinsic 
obstructions are caused by malrotation of the colon with volvulus, peritoneal bands, meconium ileus, and agangliosis 
(Hirschsprung’s disease). The most frequent site of small bowel obstruction is distal ileus (35%), followed by proximal 
jejunum (30%), distal jejunum (20%), proximal ileus (15%). In about 5% of cases, obstructions occur in multiple 
sites. Anorectal atresia results from abnormal division of the cloaca during the 9th week of development. 
Prevalence 
Intestinal obstruction is found in about 1 per 2000 births; in about half of the cases, there is small bowel obstruction 
and in the other half anorectal atresia. 
Etiology 
Although the condition is usually sporadic, in multiple intestinal atresia, familial cases have been described. 
Associated abnormalities and chromosomal defects are rare. In contrast with anorectal atresia, associated defects 
such as genitourinary, vertebral, cardiovascular and gastrointestinal anomalies are found in about 80% of cases. 
Diagnosis 
The lumens of the small bowel and colon do not normally exceed 7 mm and 20 mm, respectively. Diagnosis of 
obstruction is usually made quite late in pregnancy (after 25 weeks), as dilatation of the intestinal lumen is slow and 
progressive. Jejunal and ileal obstructions are imaged as multiple fluid-filled loops of bowel in the abdomen. 
The abdomen is usually distended and active peristalsis may be observed.
If bowel perforation occurs, transient ascites, meconium peritonitis and meconium pseudocysts may ensue.
Polyhydramnios (usually after 25 weeks) is common, especially with proximal obstructions. Bowel enlargement and 
polyhydramnios may be found in fetuses with Hirschsprung’s disease, the megacystis– microcolon–intestinal 

hypoperistalsis syndrome and congenital chloride diarrhea. When considering a diagnosis of small bowel obstruction, 
care should be taken to exclude renal tract abnormalities and other intra-abdominal cysts such as mesenteric, ovarian 
or duplication cysts. In anorectal atresia, prenatal diagnosis is usually difficult because the proximal bowel may not 
demonstrate significant dilatation and the amniotic fluid volume is usually normal; occasionally calcified intraluminal 
meconium in the fetal pelvis may be seen. 
Prognosis 
Infants with bowel obstruction typically present in the early neonatal period with symptoms of vomiting and 
abdominal distention. The prognosis is related to the gestational age at delivery, the presence of associated 
abnormalities and site of obstruction. In those born after 32 weeks with isolated obstruction requiring resection of 
only a short segment of bowel, survival is more than 95%. Loss of large segments of bowel can lead to short gut 
syndrome, which is a lethal condition. 
HIRSCHSPRUNG’SDISEASE 
Hirschsprung’s disease is characterized by congenital absence of intramural parasympathetic nerve ganglia in a 
segment of the colon. It derives from failure of migration of neuroblasts from the neural crest to the bowel segments, 
which generally occurs between the 6th and 12th weeks of gestation. Another theory suggests that the disease is 
caused by degeneration of normally migrated neuroblasts during either pre- or postnatal life. 
Prevalence 
The disease occurs in about 1 in 3000 births. 
Etiology 
It is considered to be a sporadic disease, although in about 5% of cases there is a familial inheritance. In a small 
number of cases, Hirschsprung’s disease is associated with trisomy 21. 
Diagnosis 
The aganglionic segment is unable to transmit a peristaltic wave, and therefore meconium accumulates and causes 
dilatation of the lumen of the bowel. 
The ultrasound appearance is similar to that of anorectal atresia, when the affected segment is colon or rectum. 
Polyhydramnios and dilatation of the loops are present in the case of small bowel involvement; on this occasion, it is 
not different from other types of obstruction. 
Prognosis 
Postnatal surgery is aimed at removing the affected segment and this may be a two-stage procedure with temporary 
colostomy. Neonatal mortality is approximately 20%. 

MECONIUMPERITONITIS 
Intrauterine perforation of the bowel may lead to a local sterile chemical peritonitis, with the development of a dense 
calcified mass of fibrous tissue sealing off the perforation. Bowel perforation usually occurs proximal to some form of 
obstruction, although this cannot always be demonstrated. 
Etiology 
Intestinal stenosis or atresia and meconium ileus account for 65% of the cases. Other causes include volvulus and 
Meckel’s diverticulum. Meconium ileus is the impaction of abnormally thick and sticky meconium in the distal ileum, 
and, in the majority of cases, this is due to cystic fibrosis. 
Prevalence 
Meconium peritonitis is found in about 1 in 3000 births. 
Diagnosis 
In the typical case, meconium peritonitis is featured by the association of intra-abdominal echogenic area, dilated 
bowel loops and ascites. 
The diagnosis should be considered if the fetal bowel is observed to be dilated or whenever an area of fetal intra-
abdominal hyperechogenicity is detected. 
The differential diagnosis of hyperechogenic bowel includes: intra-amniotic hemorrhage; early ascites; fetal hypoxia; 
meconium peritonitis; and cystic fibrosis. 

Meconium ileus and hyperechogenic fetal bowel at 16–18 weeks of gestation may be present in 75% of fetuses with 
cystic fibrosis. The prevalence of cystic fibrosis in fetuses with prenatal diagnosis of intestinal obstruction may be 
about 10%. Therefore, when other causes of bowel hyperechogenicity have been excluded, DNA studies for cystic 
fibrosis should be considered. 
Prognosis 
Meconium peritonitis is associated with a more than 50% mortality in the neonatal period. 
HEPATOSPLENOMEGALY 
The fetal liver and spleen can be measured by ultrasonography. Causes of hepatosplenomegaly include immune and 
non-immune hydrops, congenital infection and metabolic disorders, and it is seen in Beckwith–Wiedemann and 
Zellweger syndromes. Hepatic enlargement may also be caused by hemangioma, which is usually hypoechogenic, or 
hepatoblastoma (the most frequent malignant tumor in fetal life), in which there are areas of calcification. 
HEPATICCALCIFICATIONS 
Hepatic calcifications are echogenic foci in the parenchyma or the capsule of the liver. 
Prevalence 
Hepatic calcifications are found at mid-trimester ultrasonography in about 1 per 2000 fetuses. 
Etiology 
The vast majority of cases are idiopathic but, in a few cases, hepatic calcifications have been found in association with 
congenital infections and chromosomal abnormalities. 
Diagnosis 
Solitary or multiple echogenic foci (1–2 mm in diameter) are observed within the substance of the liver or in the 
capsule. 
Prognosis 
This depends on the presence of associated infection or chromosomal defects. Isolated foci are of no pathological 
significance. 
ABDOMINALCYSTS 
Abdominal cystic masses are frequent findings at ultrasound examination. Renal tract anomalies or dilated bowel are 
the most common explanations, although cystic structures may arise from the biliary tree, ovaries, mesentery or 
uterus. The correct diagnosis of these abnormalities may not be possible by ultrasound examination, but the most 
likely diagnosis is usually suggested by the position of the cyst, its relationship with other structures and the 

normality of other organs. 
Choledochalcysts 
Choledochal cysts represent cystic dilatation of the common biliary duct. They are uncommon and their etiology is 
unknown. Prenatally, the diagnosis may be made ultrasonographically by the demonstration of a cyst in the upper 
right side of the fetal abdomen. The differential diagnosis includes enteric duplication cyst, liver cysts, situs inversus 
or duodenal atresia. The absence of polyhydramnios or peristalsis may help to differentiate the condition from bowel 
disorders. Postnatally, early diagnosis and removal of the cyst may avoid the development of biliary cirrhosis, portal 
hypertension, calculi formation or adenocarcinoma. The operative mortality is about 10%. 
Ovariancysts 
Ovarian cysts are common and they may be found in up to one-third of newborns at autopsy, although they are 
usually small and asymptomatic. Fetal ovarian cysts are hormone-sensitive (human chorionic gonadotropin from the 
placenta) and tend to occur after 25 weeks of gestation; they are more common in diabetic or rhesus isoimmunized 
mothers as a result of placental hyperplasia. The majority of cysts are benign and resolve spontaneously in the 
neonatal period. Potential complications include development of ascites, torsion, infarction or rupture. Prenatally, the 
cysts are usually unilateral and unilocular, although, if the cyst undergoes torsion or hemorrhage, the appearance is 
complex or solid. Large ovarian cysts can be found in association with polyhydramnios, possibly as a consequence of 
compression of the bowel. Obstetric management should not be changed, unless an enormous or rapidly enlarging 
cyst is detected or there is associated polyhydramnios; in these cases, prenatal aspiration may be considered. A 
difficult differential diagnosis is from hydrometrocolpos, which also presents as a cystic or solid mass arising from the 
pelvis of a female fetus. Other genitourinary or gastrointestinal anomalies are common and include renal agenesis, 
polycystic kidneys, esophageal atresia, duodenal atresia and imperforate anus. Most cases are sporadic, although a 
few cases are genetic, such as the autosomal recessive McKusick–Kaufman syndrome with hydrometrocolpos, 
polydactyly and congenital heart disease. 
Mesentericoromentalcysts 
Mesenteric or omental cysts may represent obstructed lymphatic drainage or lymphatic hamartomas. The fluid 
contents may be serous, chylous or hemorrhagic. Antenatally, the diagnosis is suggested by the finding of a 
multiseptate or unilocular, usually mid-line, cystic lesion of variable size; a solid appearance may be secondary to 
hemorrhage. Antenatal aspiration may be considered in cases of massive cysts resulting in thoracic compression. 
Postnatal management is conservative and surgery is reserved for cases with symptoms of bowel obstruction or acute 
abdominal pain following torsion or hemorrhage into a cyst. Complete excision of cysts may not be possible because 
of the proximity of major blood vessels and in up to 20% of cases there is recurrence after surgery. Although 
malignant change in mesenteric cysts has been described, this is rare. 
Hepaticcysts 
Hepatic cysts are typically located in the right lobe of the liver. They are quite rare and result from obstruction of the 
hepatic biliary system. They appear as unilocular, intrahepatic cysts, and they are usually asymptomatic, although 
rarely may show complications such as infections or hemorrhages. In 30% of the cases of polycystic kidneys (adult 
type), asymptomatic hepatic cysts may be associated. 
Intestinalduplicationcysts 
These are quite rare, and may be located along the entire gastrointestinal tract. They sonographically appear as 
tubular or cystic structures of variable size. They may be isolated or associated with other gastrointestinal 
malformations. Differential diagnosis includes other intra-abdominal cystic structures and also bronchogenic cysts, 
adenomatoid cystic malformation of the lung and pulmonary sequestration. Thickness of the muscular wall of the 
cysts and presence of peristalsis may facilitate the diagnosis. Postnatally, surgical removal is carried out. 
Anomaliesoftheumbilicalvein 
Abnormalities of the umbilical vein, which are very rare, can be divided in three groups: 
(1) Persistence of the right umbilical vein with ductus venosus and presence or absence of left umbical vein; 

(2) Absence of the ductus venosus with extrahepatic insertion of the umbilical vein; and 
(3) Dilated umbilical vein with normal insertion. 
Normally, the umbilical vein enters the abdomen almost centrally at the level of the liver and courses on the left of 
the gallbladder. Persistence of the right umbilical vein is demonstrated by the fact that it is localized on the right of 
the gallbladder, bending towards the stomach. Color Doppler may help to diagnose these anomalies and may allow 
the differential diagnosis with other cystic abdominal lesions. Associated anomalies are frequent in anomalies of the 
first two groups and this influences the prognosis. These anomalies include cardiac, skeletal, gastrointestinal and 
urinary anomalies. The anomalies of the third group are rarely associated with other anomalies, and prognosis 
depends on the time at diagnosis and dimension of the varicosity.

Chapter 8 
Kidneys and urinary tract 
NORMAL SONOGRAPHIC ANATOMY 
The kidneys and adrenals, located below the level of the stomach, on either side and anterior to the spine, are visible 
by ultrasonography from as early as 9 weeks of gestation and in all cases from 12 weeks. The renal echogenicity is 
high at 9 weeks but decreases with gestation; the adrenals appear as translucent structures with an echodense 
cortex. 
Longitudinal and transverse sections of the abdomen can be used to study the kidneys. In a longitudinal scan, kidneys 
appear as elliptical areas, while on transverse scan they appear as roundish structures at both sides of the spine. The 
kidneys appear slightly hypoechoic, compared to the liver and bowel loops. At 20 weeks, the kidneys show a 
hyperechoic capsule and the cortical area is slightly more echogenic than the medulla. With progressing gestation, fat 
tissue accumulates around the kidneys, enhancing the borders of the kidneys in contrast with the other splanchnic 
organs. At 26–28 weeks, renal pyramids can be detected, and the arcuate arteries can be seen pulsating in their 
proximity. Both the renal length and circumference increase with gestation, but the ratio of renal to abdominal 
circumference remains approximately 30% throughout pregnancy. The anteroposterior diameter of the renal pelvis 
should be < 5 mm at 15–19 weeks, < 6 mm at 20–29 weeks and < 8 mm at 30–40 weeks. The normal ureters are 
rarely seen in the absence of distal obstruction or reflux. The fetal bladder can be visualized from the first trimester 
(in about 80% of fetuses at 11 weeks and more than 90% by 13 weeks); changes in volume over time help to 
differentiate it from other cystic pelvic structures. 
RENAL AGENESIS 
Renal agenesis is the consequence of failure of differentiation of the metanephric blastema during the 25–28th day of 
development and both ureters and kidneys and renal arteries are absent. 
Prevalence 
Bilateral renal agenesis is found in 1 per 5000 births, while unilateral disease is found in 1 per 2000 births. 
Etiology 
Renal agenesis is usually an isolated sporadic abnormality but, in a few cases, it may be secondary to a chromosomal 
abnormality or part of a genetic syndrome (such as Fraser syndrome), or a developmental defect (such as VACTERL 
association). In non-syndromic cases, the risk of recurrence is approximately 3%. However, in about 15% of cases, 
one of the parents has unilateral renal agenesis and in these families the risk of recurrence is increased. 

Diagnosis 
Antenatally, the condition is suspected by the combination of anhydramnios (from 17 weeks) and empty fetal bladder 
(from as early as 14 weeks). Examination of the renal areas is often hampered by the oligohydramnios and the 
‘crumpled’ position adopted by these fetuses, and care should be taken to avoid the mistaken diagnosis of perirenal 
fat and large fetal adrenals for the absent kidneys. The differential diagnosis is from preterm rupture of membranes, 
severe uteroplacental insufficiency and obstructive uropathy or bilateral multicystic or polycystic kidneys. Vaginal 
sonography with high-frequency, high-resolution probes is useful in these cases. 
Failure to visualize the renal arteries with color Doppler is another important clue to the diagnosis in dubious cases, 
both with bilateral and unilateral agenesis. Prenatal diagnosis of unilateral renal agenesis is difficult because there are 
no major features, such as anhydramnios and empty bladder, to alert the ultrasonographer to the fact that one of the 
kidneys is absent. 
Prognosis 
Bilateral renal agenesis is a lethal condition, usually in the neonatal period due to pulmonary hypoplasia. The 
prognosis with unilateral agenesis is normal. 
INFANTILE POLYCYSTIC KIDNEY DISEASE (POTTER TYPE I) 
In this condition, the markedly enlarged kidneys are filled with numerous cortical cysts and dilated collecting ducts. 
The disease has a wide spectrum of renal and hepatic involvement and it is subdivided into perinatal (this is the most 
common), neonatal, infantile and juvenile types on the basis of the age of onset of the clinical presentation and the 
degree of renal tubular involvement. Although recurrences tend to be group-specific, we have seen one family in 
which the four subdivisions were each represented in the four affected infants. 

Prevalence
Infantile polycystic kidney disease is found in about 1 per 30 000 births. 
Etiology 
This is an autosomal recessive condition. The responsible gene is in the short arm of chromosome 6 and prenatal 
diagnosis in families at risk can be carried out by first-trimester chorion villous sampling. 
Diagnosis 
Prenatal diagnosis is confined to the types with earlier onset (perinatal and probably the neonatal types) and is based 
on the demonstration of bilaterally enlarged and homogeneously hyperechogenic kidneys. There is often associated 
oligohydramnios, but this is not invariably so. These sonographic appearances, however, may not become apparent 
before 24 weeks of gestation and, therefore, serial scans should be performed for exclusion of the diagnosis. 
Prognosis 
The perinatal type is lethal either in utero or in the neonatal period due to pulmonary hypoplasia. The neonatal type 
results in death due to renal failure within the 1st year of life. The infantile and juvenile types result in chronic renal 
failure, hepatic fibrosis and portal hypertension; many cases survive into their teens and require renal 
transplantation. 
MULTICYSTIC DYSPLASTIC KIDNEY DISEASE (POTTER TYPE II) 
Multicystic dysplastic kidney disease is thought to be a consequence of either developmental failure of the 
mesonephric blastema to form nephrons or early obstruction due to urethral or ureteric atresia. The collecting tubules 
become cystic and the diameter of the cysts determines the size of the kidneys, which may be enlarged or small. 
Exploration of the renal fossa in some cases reveals no renal artery, renal vein, ureter or cysts, suggesting that renal 
agenesis and dysplastic kidneys may be at different ends of a spectrum of renal malformation. This is further 
supported by the finding that, in about 15% of cases with multicystic kidneys, there is contralateral renal agenesis. 
Prevalence 
Multicystic dysplastic kidney disease is found in about 1 per 1000 births. 
Etiology 
In the majority of cases, this is a sporadic abnormality but chromosomal abnormalities (mainly trisomy 18), genetic 
syndromes and other defects (mainly cardiac) are present in about 50% of the cases. 

Diagnosis 
Ultrasonographically, the kidneys are replaced by multiple irregular cysts of variable size with intervening 
hyperechogenic stroma. The disorder can be bilateral, unilateral or segmental; if bilateral, there is associated 
anhydramnios and the bladder is ‘absent’. 
Prognosis 
Bilateral multicystic dysplastic kidney disease is fatal before or soon after birth, due to pulmonary hypoplasia. 
Unilateral disease is associated with a normal prognosis. There is still controversy in the postnatal management of 
patients with a multicystic kidney; some urologists advocate prophylactic nephrectomy, but the majority adopt an 
expectant approach because the kidney gradually shrinks and may disappear. The parents and family should also be 
scanned to exclude autosomal dominant branchio-to-renal syndrome. 
POTTER TYPE III RENAL DYSPLASIA 
Potter type III renal dysplasia is characterized by markedly enlarged irregular kidneys with innumerable cysts of 
variable sizes interspersed among normal or compressed renal parenchyma. It is the common morphological 
expression of autosomal dominant adult polycystic kidney disease (APKD) and of other Mendelian disorders such as 
tuberous sclerosis, Jeune syndrome, Sturge–Weber syndrome, Zellweger syndrome, Lawrence Moon Biedl syndrome 
and Meckel–Gruber syndrome. Both kidneys are generally equally enlarged and only rarely is one involved so slightly 
that it remains of normal size. One-third of the cases have cysts in the liver, pancreas, spleen or lungs and one-fifth 
are found to have cerebral aneurysms. 
Adult polycystic kidney disease (APKD) 
One in 1000 people carry the APKD mutant gene. Adult polycystic kidney disease is usually asymptomatic until the 
third or fourth decade of life, and, although histological evidence of the disease is likely to be present from 
intrauterine life, the age of onset of gross morphological changes that are potentially detectable by ultrasonography is 
uncertain. Rarely, however, kidneys that are anatomically similar may cause death in infancy or early childhood and 
the condition has been designated as ‘adult variety occurring in infancy’. 
Prenatal diagnosis by ultrasonography is confined to a few case reports and the kidneys have been described as 
enlarged and hyperechogenic with or without multiple cysts. Unlike infantile polycystic kidneys, where there is a loss 
of the corticomedullary junction, in APKD there is accentuation of this junction. The amniotic fluid volume is either 
normal or reduced. 

The kidney size is usually smaller than that of the infant polycystic kidneys. In counselling affected parents with 
APKD, it should be emphasized that the prenatal demonstration of sonographically normal kidneys does not 
necessarily exclude the possibility of developing polycystic kidneys in adult life. Nevertheless, prenatal diagnosis can 
now be made from chorion villous sampling and DNA analysis. 
OBSTRUCTIVE UROPATHIES 
The term ‘obstructive uropathy’ encompasses a wide variety of different pathological conditions characterized by 
dilatation of part or all of the urinary tract. When the obstruction is complete and occurs early in fetal life, renal 
hypoplasia (deficiency in total nephron population) and dysplasia (Potter type II; formation of abnormal nephrons and 
mesenchymal stroma) ensue. On the other hand, where intermittent obstruction allows for normal renal development, 
or when it occurs in the second half of pregnancy, hydronephrosis will result and the severity of the renal damage will 
depend on the degree and duration of the obstruction. Dilatation of the fetal urinary tract frequently, but not 
absolutely, signifies obstruction. Conversely, a fetus with obstruction may not have any urinary tract dilatation. 
Hydronephrosis 
Varying degrees of pelvicalyceal dilatation are found in about 1% of fetuses. Mild hydronephrosis or pyelectasia is 
defined by the presence of an anteroposterior diameter of the pelvis of > 4 mm at 15–19 weeks, > 5 mm at 20–29 
weeks and > 7 mm at 30–40 weeks. Transient hydronephrosis may be due to relaxation of smooth muscle of the 
urinary tract by the high levels of circulating maternal hormones, or maternal–fetal overhydration. In the majority of 
cases, the condition remains stable or resolves in the neonatal period. In about 20% of cases, there may be an 
underlying ureteropelvic junction obstruction or vesicoureteric reflux that requires postnatal follow-up and possible 
surgery. 
Moderate hydronephrosis, characterized by an anteroposterior pelvic diameter of more than 10 mm and pelvicalyceal 
dilatation, is usually progressive and in more than 50% of cases surgery is necessary during the first 2 years of life. 

Ureteropelvic junction obstruction 
This is usually sporadic and, although in some cases there is an anatomic cause, such as ureteral valves, in most 
instances the underlying cause is thought to be functional. In 80% of cases, the condition is unilateral. Prenatal 
diagnosis is based on the demonstration of hydronephrosis in the absence of dilated ureters and bladder. The degree 
of pelvicalyceal dilatation is variable and, occasionally, perinephric urinomas and urinary ascites may be present. 
Postnatally, renal function is assessed by serial isotope imaging studies and, if there is deterioration, pyeloplasty is 
performed. However, the majority of infants have moderate or good function and can be managed expectantly. 
Ureterovesical junction obstruction 
This is a sporadic abnormality characterized by hydronephrosis and hydroureter in the presence of a normal bladder. 
The dilated ureter is tortuous, and on ultrasound appears as a collection of cysts of variable size, localized between 
the renal pelvis, which is variably dilated, and the bladder, which is of normal morphology and dimensions. The 
etiology is diverse, including ureteric stricture or atresia, retrocaval ureter, vascular obstruction, valves, diverticulum, 
ureterocele, and vesicoureteral reflux. Ureteroceles (visible as a thin-walled and fluid-filled small circular area inside 
the bladder) are usually found in association with duplication of the collecting system. In ureteral duplication, the 
upper pole moiety characteristically obstructs and the lower one refluxes. The dilated upper pole may enlarge to 
displace the non-dilated lower pole inferiorly and laterally. 
Vesicoureteric reflux 
This sporadic abnormality is suspected when intermittent dilatation of the upper urinary tract over a short period of 
time is seen on ultrasound scanning. Occasionally, in massive vesicoureteric reflux without obstruction, the bladder 
appears persistently dilated because it empties but rapidly refills with refluxed urine. Primary megaureter can be 
distinguished from ureterovesical junction obstruction by the absence of significant hydronephrosis. 

Megacystis–microcolon–intestinal hypoperistalsis syndrome (MMIHS) 
This is a sporadic abnormality characterized by a massively dilated bladder and hydronephrosis in the presence of 
normal or increased amniotic fluid; the fetuses are usually female. There is associated shortening and dilatation of the 
proximal small bowel, and microcolon with absent or ineffective peristalsis. The condition is usually lethal due to 
bowel and renal dysfunction. 
Urethral obstruction 
Urethral obstruction can be caused by urethral agenesis, persistence of the cloaca, urethral stricture or posterior 
urethral valves. Posterior urethral valves occur only in males and are the commonest cause of bladder outlet 
obstruction. The condition is sporadic and is found in about 1 in 3000 male fetuses. With posterior urethral valves, 
there is usually incomplete or intermittent obstruction of the urethra, resulting in an enlarged and hypertrophied 
bladder with varying degrees of hydroureters, hydronephrosis, a spectrum of renal hypoplasia and dysplasia, 
oligohydramnios and pulmonary hypoplasia. In some cases, there is associated urinary ascites from rupture of the 
bladder or transudation of urine into the peritoneal cavity. 
Fetal therapy for obstructive uropathy 
In fetal lamb, ureteric ligation during the first half of gestation results in dysplastic kidneys, whereas, in the second 
half of pregnancy, ureteric ligation is associated with the development of hydronephrosis but preservation of renal 
architecture. Ligation of the urethra and urachus in fetal lambs at 100 days of gestation causes severe hydronephrosis 
and pulmonary hypoplasia; decompression by suprapubic cystostomy at 120 days’ gestation reduces the urinary tract 
dilatation and improves the survival rate. Similarly, ureteric ligation at 65 days of gestation produces renal dysplasia, 
and subsequent decompression prior to term prevents renal dysplasia and produces reversible postobstructive 
changes; the degree of renal damage is proportional to the length of time for which the obstruction existed. 
Encouraged by the results of these animal studies, and on the assumption that unrelieved obstruction causes 
progressive renal and pulmonary damage, several investigators in the 1980s performed in utero decompression of the 
urinary tract in the human, either by open surgical diversion or by the ultrasound-guided insertion of suprapubic 

vesico-amniotic catheters. Although these techniques demonstrated the feasibility of intrauterine surgery, they did 
not provide conclusive evidence that such intervention improves renal or pulmonary function beyond what can be 
achieved by postnatal surgery. It is possible that, in a few selected cases, intrauterine intervention may be beneficial. 
Assessment of fetal renal function 
Antenatal evaluation of renal function relies on a combination of ultrasonographic findings and analysis of fetal urine 
obtained by urodochocentesis or pyelocentesis. Poor prognostic signs are: 
(1) The presence of bilateral multicystic or severely hydronephrotic kidneys with echogenic kidneys, suggestive of 
renal dysplasia; 
(2) Anhydramnios implying complete urethral obstruction; and 
(3) High urinary sodium, calcium and J2 microglobulin levels. 
Potential candidates for intrauterine surgery are fetuses with bilateral moderately severe pelvicalyceal dilatation and 
normal cortical echogenicity, or severe megacystis and oligohydramnios, or normal levels of urinary sodium, calcium 
and J2 microglobulin.

NORMALSONOGRAPHICANATOMY 
Limb buds are first seen by ultrasound at about the 8th week of gestation; the femur and humerus are seen from 9 
weeks, the tibia/fibula and radius/ulna from 10 weeks and the digits of the hands and the feet from 11 weeks. All long 
bones are consistently seen from 11 weeks. Body movements (wiggling) are seen at 9 weeks and, by 11 weeks, limbs 
move about readily. The lengths of the humerus, radius/ulna, femur and tibia/fibula are similar and increase linearly 
with gestation. At the 18–23-week scan, the three segments of each extremity should be visualized, but it is only 
necessary to measure the length of one femur. The relationship of leg and foot should also be assessed to rule out 
clubfoot.

SKELETALANOMALIES 
Prevalence 
Skeletal dysplasia is found in about 1 per 4000 births; about 25% of affected fetuses are stillborn and about 30% die 
in the neonatal period. 
Classification 
The existing nomenclature for skeletal dysplasias is complicated. Some disorders are referred to by eponyms (such as 
Ellis–Van Creveld syndrome), by Greek terms describing a salient feature of the disease (diastrophic or twisted, 
metatrophic or changeable) or by a term related to the presumed pathogenesis of the disease (such as osteogenesis 
imperfecta). The fundamental problem with any classification of skeletal dysplasias is that the pathogenesis of these 
diseases is largely unknown and, therefore, the current system relies on purely descriptive findings of either clinical or 
radiological nature. According to the International Nomenclature for Skeletal Dysplasias, the diseases are subdivided 
into three different groups: 
(1) Osteochondrodysplasias (abnormalities of cartilage and / or bone growth and development); 
(2) Disorganized development of cartilaginous and fibrous components of the skeleton; and 
(3) Idiopathic osteolyses. 
Approach to prenatal diagnosis 
There is a wide range of rare skeletal dyplasias, each with a specific recurrence risk, dysmorphic expression, and 
implications for neonatal survival and quality of life. Our knowledge of the in utero expression of these syndromes is 
based on a few case reports and, therefore, in attempting to perform prenatal diagnosis of individual conditions in at-
risk families, extrapolation of findings from the perinatal period is often necessary. The incidental discovery of a 
skeletal dysplasia on routine ultrasound screening, in a pregnancy not known to be at risk of a specific syndrome, 
necessitates a systematic examination to arrive at the correct diagnosis. All limbs must be evaluated as to their 
length, shape, mineralization and movement, and associated abnormalities in other systems, particularly the head, 
thorax and spine, should be sought. 

Assessment of long bones 
Shortening of the extremities can involve the entire limb (micromelia, such as achondrogenesis, short-rib polydactyly 
syndrome, diastrophic dysplasia osteogenesis imperfecta type II), the proximal segment (rhizomelia, such as 
achondroplasia), the intermediate segment (mesomelia, such as mesomelic dysplasia) or the distal segment 
(acromelia, such as Ellis–Van Creveld syndrome). The diagnosis of rhizomelia or mesomelia requires comparison of 
the dimensions of the bones of the leg and forearm with those of the thigh and arm. The femur, however, is 
abnormally short even in mesomelic dwarfism and, therefore, in our routine fetal abnormality screening, we tend to 
confine limb measurements to that of the femur. When dealing with pregnancies at risk for a skeletal dysplasia, both 
segments of all limbs are measured. 
The severe limb reductions associated with osteogenesis imperfecta type II, achondrogenesis and thanatophoric, 
diastrophic, and chondroectodermal dysplasias can be detected by a single measurement of the femur length at 16– 
18 weeks of gestation. In the case of achondroplasia, however, the diagnosis may not become obvious until 22–24 
weeks and, therefore, serial measurements are necessary; homozygous achondroplasia, which is usually lethal, 
manifests in abnormally short limbs earlier than the heterozygous form. 
A minor degree of lateral curvature of the femur is commonly seen in normal fetuses. Pronounced bowing, however, 
is observed in association with campomelic dysplasia, thanatophoric dwarfism, autosomal dominant osteogenesis 
imperfecta, achondrogenesis and hypophosphatasia. In the latter, fractures and callus formation may also be 
detected. Reduced echogenicity of bones, suggestive of hypomineralization, is seen in such disorders as 
hypophosphatasia, osteogenesis imperfecta and achondrogenesis. The virtual absence of ossification of the spine, 
characteristic of achondrogenesis, may lead to the erroneous diagnosis of complete spinal agenesis. Similarly, the 
pronounced clarity with which the cerebral ventricles are imaged, as a result of the poorly mineralized globular 
cranium in cases of hypophosphatasia, may result in the misdiagnosis of hydrocephalus. Care must be exercised, 
however, because lesser degrees of hypomineralization may not be detectable. 
Isolated limb reduction deformities, such as amelia (complete absence of extremities), acheiria (absence of the hand), 
phocomelia (seal limb) or aplasia–hypoplasia of the radius or ulna, are often inherited as part of a genetic syndrome 
(Holt–Oram syndrome, Fanconi pancytopenia, thrombocytopenia with absent radii syndrome) and are readily 
diagnosible by ultrasonography in an at-risk fetus. Other causes of focal limb loss include the amniotic band 
syndrome, thalidomide exposure and caudal regression syndrome. 
Evaluation of hands and feet 
Fetal fingers and toes can be seen, and, with meticulous examination, abnormalities of numbers, shape, movement 
and attitudes can be recognized. Several skeletal dysplasias feature alterations of the hands and feet. Polydactyly 
refers to the presence of more than five digits. It is classified as postaxial if the extra digits are on the ulnar or fibular 
side and preaxial if they are located on the radial or tibial side. Syndactyly refers to soft tissue or bony fusion of 
adjacent digits. Clinodactyly consists of deviation of a finger(s). Disproportion between hands and feet and the other 
parts of the extremity may also be a sign of a skeletal dysplasia. 
Examination of fetal movements 
Maternal perception of fetal movements is usually decreased in fetuses with skeletal dysplasias, such as 
achondrogenesis and thanatophoric dysplasia. Ultrasonography can aid in the diagnosis of conditions characterized by 
limitation of flexion or extension of the limbs, such as arthrogryposis and multiple pterygium syndrome. 
Evaluation of thoracic dimensions 
Several skeletal dysplasias are associated with a small thorax, and chest restriction leads to pulmonary hypoplasia, 
which is the common cause of death in these conditions. The appropriateness of thoracic dimensions can be assessed 
by measuring the thoracic circumference at the level of the four-chamber view of the heart and examining the 
thoracic-to-abdominal circumference ratio, the thoracic-to-head circumference ratio, or the thoracic-to-cardiac 
circumference ratio. 

Skeletal dysplasias associated with a long narrow thorax include asphyxiating thoracic dysplasia (Jeune), 
chondroectodermal dysplasia (Ellis–Van Creveld), campomelic dysplasia, Jarcho–Levin syndrome, achondrogenesis 
and hypophosphatasia. Dysplasias with a short thorax include osteogenesis imperfecta (type II), Kniest’s dysplasia 
(metatrophic dysplasia type II) and Pena–Shokeir syndrome. Hypoplastic thorax is found in short-rib polydactyly 
syndrome (type I, type II), thanatophoric dysplasia, cerebrocostomandibular syndrome, cleidocranial dysostosis 
syndrome, homozygous achondroplasia, Melnick–Needles syndrome (osteodysplasty), fibrochondrogenesis and 
otopalatodigital syndrome type II. 
Evaluation of the fetal head 
Several skeletal dysplasias are associated with defects of membranous ossification and, therefore, affect skull bones. 
The face should also be examined for the diagnosis of hypertelorism, micrognathia, short upper lip, and abnormalities 
of the ears. 
Diagnostic tests complementary to sonography 
Prenatal or postnatal evaluation includes chromosomal studies, biochemical investigations (e.g. hypophosphatasia) 
and DNA analysis for an increasing number of the osteochondrodysplasias. Postnatally, examination of skeletal 
radiographs is of particular importance, since the classification of skeletal dysplasias is largely based upon 
radiographic findings. 
OSTEOCHONDRODYSPLASIAS 
Thanatophoric dysplasia 
This is the most common lethal skeletal dysplasia with a birth prevalence of about 1 in 10 000. The term derives from 
the Greek, meaning death-bearing and the characteristic features are severe shortening of the limbs, narrow thorax, 
normal trunk length and large head with prominent forehead. In type I, which is sporadic, the femurs are curved 
(telephone receiver) and in type II, which is autosomal recessive, the femurs are straight but the skull is cloverleaf-
shaped. 

Achondrogenesis 
This is a lethal skeletal dysplasia with a birth prevalence of about 1 in 40 000. The characteristic features are severe 
shortening of the limbs, narrow thorax, short trunk and large head. In achondrogenesis type I, which is autosomal 
recessive, there is poor mineralization of both the skull and vertebral bodies as well as rib fractures. In type II, which 
is sporadic (new autosomal dominant mutations), there is hypomineralization of the vertebral bodies but normal 
mineralization of the skull, and there are no rib fractures. 

Osteogenesis imperfecta 
Osteogenesis imperfecta is a genetically heterogeneous group of disorders presenting with fragility of bones, blue 
sclerae, loose joints and growth deficiency. The underlying defect is a dominant negative mutation affecting COL1A1 
or COL1A2 alleles, which encode the proA1(I) and proa2(I) chains of type I collagen, a protein of paramount 
importance for normal skin and bone development. The mutations result in the production of abnormal quantity (OI 
type I) or quality (types II, III and IV) of collagen. 
There are four clinical subtypes. In type I, which is an autosomal dominant condition with a birth prevalence of about 
1 in 30 000, affected individuals have fragile bones, blue sclerae and progressive deafness, but life expectancy is 
normal. Prenatal diagnosis is available by DNA analysis. Ultrasonography in the second and third trimesters may 
demonstrate fractures of long bones. 
In type II, which is a lethal disorder with a birth prevalence of about 1 in 60 000, most cases represent new dominant 
mutations (recurrence is about 6%). The disorder is characterized by early prenatal onset of severe bone shortening 
and bowing due to multiple fractures affecting all long bones and ribs, and poor mineralization of the skull. 
Type III is a progressively deforming condition characterized by multiple fractures, usually present at birth, resulting 
in scoliosis and very short stature. Bowing of the femur has been described in these cases in utero. Both autosomal 
dominant and recessive modes of inheritance have been reported. 

Type IV is an autosomal dominant condition with variable expressivity. Severely affected individuals may have 
deformities of the long bones due to fractures. Prenatal diagnosis of types III and IV can be made by chorion villous 
sampling and DNA analysis, or by demonstration of abnormal collagen production in cultured fibroblasts. 
Hypophosphatasia 
This lethal, autosomal recessive condition, with a birth prevalence of about 1 in 100 000, is characterized by severe 
shortening of the long bones, small thorax, hypomineralization of the skull and long bones. There is absence of liver 
and bone isoenzymes of alkaline phosphatase, and first-trimester diagnosis is made by measurement of alkaline 
phosphatase isoenzymes in chorion villous samples. The diagnosis can also be made by DNA studies. 
Achondroplasia 
This autosomal dominant syndrome has a birth prevalence of about 1 in 26 000, but the majority of cases represent 
new mutations. The characteristic features of heterozygous achondroplasia include short limbs, lumbar lordosis, short 
hands and fingers, macrocephaly with frontal bossing and depressed nasal bridge. 
Intelligence and life expectancy are normal. Prenatally, limb shortening and typical facis usually become apparent 
only after 22 weeks of gestation. In the homozygous state, which is a lethal condition, short limbs are associated with 
a narrow thorax. Achondroplasia is due to a specific mutation within the fibroblast growth factor receptor type 3 gene 
(FGFR3) and can now be diagnosed by DNA analysis of fetal blood or amniotic fluid obtained in cases of suspicious 
sonographic findings. In cases where both parents have achondroplasia, there is a 25% chance that the fetus is 
affected by the lethal type and the diagnosis can be made by first-trimester chorion villous sampling. 
Campomelic dysplasia 
This lethal, autosomal recessive syndrome with a birth prevalence of 1 in 200 000 is characterized by shortening and 
bowing of the long bones of the legs, narrow chest, hypoplastic scapulae, and large calvarium with disproportionately 
small face. Some of the affected genetically male individuals show a female phenotype. Patients usually die in the 
neonatal period from pulmonary hypoplasia. 

Jarcho–Levin syndrome 
This is a heterogeneous disorder, characterized by vertebral and rib abnormalities (misalignment of the cervical spine 
and ribs). An autosomal recessive type is characterized by a constricted short thorax and respiratory death in infancy. 
Another autosomal recessive and an autosomal dominant type are associated with a short stature and are compatible 
with survival to adult life but with some degree of physical disability. 
Asphyxiating thoracic dysplasia (Jeune syndrome) 
This is an autosomal recessive condition with a birth prevalence of about 1 in 70 000. The characteristic features are 
narrow chest and rhizomelic limb shortening. There is a variable phenotypic expression and, consequently, the 
prognosis varies from neonatal death, due to pulmonary hypoplasia, to normal survival. Limb shortening is mild to 
moderate and this may not become apparent until after 24 weeks of gestation. 
Chondroectodermal dysplasia (Ellis–Van Creveld syndrome) 
This rare, autosomal recessive condition is characterized by acromelic and mesomelic shortness of limbs, postaxial 
polydactyly, small chest, ectodermal dysplasia, and congenital heart defects in more than 50% of cases. 
Short limb polydactyly syndromes 
This group of lethal disorders is characterized by short limbs, narrow thorax and postaxial polydactyly. Associated 
anomalies are frequently found, including congenital heart disease, polycystic kidneys, and intestinal atresia. Four 
different types have been recognized. Type I (Saldino–Noonan) has narrow metaphyses; type II (Majewski) has cleft 
lip and palate and disproportionally shortened tibiae; type III (Naumoff) has wide metaphyses with spurs; type IV 
(Beemer–Langer) is characterized by median cleft lip, small chest with extremely short ribs, protuberant abdomen 
with umbilical hernia and ambiguous genitalia in some 46,XY individuals. 
Diastrophic dysplasia 
This autosomal recessive condition is characterized by severe shortening and bowing of all long bones, talipes 
equinovarus, hand deformities with abducted position of the thumbs (‘hitchhiker thumb’), multiple joint flexion 
contractures and scoliosis. There is a wide spectrum in phenotypic expression and some cases may not be 
diagnosable in utero. This disease is not lethal and neurodevelopment is normal. 
LIMBDEFICIENCYORCONGENITALAMPUTATIONS 
Absence of an extremity or a segment of an extremity is referred to as ‘limb deficiency’ or ‘congenital amputation’. 
The prevalence of limb reduction deformities is about 1 per 20 000 births. In about 50% of cases, there are simple 
transverse reduction deficiencies of one forearm or hand without associated anomalies. In the other 50% of cases, 
there are multiple reduction deficiencies and, in 25% of these, there are additional anomalies of the internal organs or 
craniofacial structures. In general, limb deficiency of the upper extremity is an isolated anomaly, whereas congenital 
amputation of the leg or bilateral amputations or reductions of all limbs are usually part of a genetic syndrome. 
Isolated amputation of an extremity can be due to amniotic band syndrome, exposure to a teratogen or a vascular 
accident. There is an association between chorion villous sampling before 10 weeks of gestation and transverse limb 

defects. Syndromes associated with limb deficiencies include the aglossia–adactylia syndrome (transverse 
amputations of the limbs ranging from absent digits to severe deficiencies of all four extremities, micrognathia, and 
vestigial tongue or ankylosis of the tongue to the hard palate, the floor of the mouth or the lips), and the Moebius 
sequence (facial anomalies attributed to paralysis of the 6th and 7th cranial nerves, leading to micrognathia and 
ptosis with upper limb defects, ranging from transverse amputations to absent digits). Both syndromes are sporadic. 
Limb reduction defects associated with other anomalies include the CHILD syndrome (congenital hemidysplasia with 
ichthyosiform erythroderma and limb defects). This is characterized by strict demarcation of the skin lesions to one 
side of the mid-line and limb deficiencies, which are unilateral, varying from hypoplasia of phalanges to complete 
absence of an extremity. The condition is also associated with heart defects and unilateral hydronephrosis or renal 
agenesis. 
In phocomelia, the extremities resemble those of a seal. Typically, the hands and feet are present (these may be 
normal or abnormal), but the intervening arms and legs are absent. Phocomelia can also be caused by exposure to 
thalidomide, but this is only of historical interest. Three syndromes must be considered in the differential diagnosis of 
phocomelia: Roberts syndrome (autosomal recessive disorder characterized by the association of tetraphocomelia and 
facial clefting defects or hypoplastic nasal alae), some varieties of thrombocytopenia with absent radius (TAR 
syndrome) and Grebe syndrome (autosomal recessive condition, described in the inbred Indian tribes of Brazil, 
characterized by marked hypomelia of upper and lower limbs, increasing in severity from proximal to distal segments 
– in contrast to Roberts syndrome, the lower limbs are more affected than the upper extremities). 
Congenital short femur has been classified into five groups: type I, simple hypoplasia of the femur; type II, short 
femur with angulated shaft; type III, short femur with coxa vara (the most common); type IV, absent or defective 
proximal femur; and type V, absent or rudimentary femur. One or both femurs can be affected but the right femur is 
more frequently involved. Femoral hypoplasia–unusual facies syndrome, which is sporadic, consists of bilateral 
femoral hypoplasia and facial defects, including short nose with broad tip, long philtrum, micrognathia and cleft 
palate. 
If the defect is unilateral, it may correspond to the femur–fibula–ulna or femur–tibia–radius complex. These two 
syndromes have different implications for genetic counselling; the former is non-familial, while the second has a 
strong genetic component. 
SPILTHANDANDFOOTSYNDROME 
The term ‘split hand and foot’ syndrome refers to a group of disorders characterized by splitting of the hand and foot 
into two parts; other terms include lobster-claw deformity and ectrodactyly. The conditions are classified into typical 
and atypical varieties. The typical variety (found in 1 per 90 000 births and usually inherited with an autosomal 
dominant pattern) consists of absence of both the finger and the metacarpal bone, resulting in a deep V-shaped 
central defect that clearly divides the hand into an ulnar and a radial part. The atypical variety (found in 1 per 150 

000 births) is characterized by a much wider cleft formed by a defect of the metacarpals and the middle fingers; the 
cleft is U-shaped and wide, with only the thumb and small finger remaining. 
Split hand and foot deformities can occur as isolated anomalies, but more commonly they are part of a more complex 
syndrome. Ectrodactyly–ectodermal dysplasia–cleft lip/palate syndrome (EEC syndrome), which is autosomal 
dominant, involves the four extremities with more severe deformities of the hands; the spectrum of ectodermal 
defects is wide, including dry skin, sparse hair, dental defects and defects of the tear duct. Other syndromes include 
split foot and triphalangeal thumb, split foot and hand and central polydactyly, Karsch–Neugebauer syndrome (split 
hand/foot with congenital nystagmus), acrorenal syndrome and mandibulofacial dysostosis (Fontaine syndrome). 
CLUBHANDS 
Clubhand deformities are classified into two main categories: radial and ulnar. Radial clubhand includes a wide 
spectrum of disorders that encompass absent thumb, thumb hypoplasia, thin first metacarpal and absent radius. 
Ulnar clubhand, which is less common, ranges from mild deviations of the hand on the ulnar side of the forearm to 
complete absence of the ulna. While radial clubhand is frequently syndromatic, ulnar clubhand is usually an isolated 
anomaly. 
Clubhand deformities are often found in association with chromosomal abnormalities (such as trisomy 18), 
hematological abnormalities (such as Fanconi’s pancytopenia, TAR syndrome and Aase syndrome), or genetic 
syndromes with cardiac defects (such as Holt–Oram syndrome, or the Lewis upper limb–cardiovascular syndrome). 
Radial clubhand is also associated with congenital scoliosis. The three syndromes that should be considered part of 
the differential diagnosis include the VATER association (vertebral segmentation, ventricular septal defect, anal 
atresia, tracheoesophageal fistula, radial and renal defects, and single umbilical artery), Goldenhar syndrome and the 
Klippel–Feil syndrome. 
POLYDACTYLY 
Polydactyly is the presence of an additional digit, which may range from a fleshy nubbin to a complete digit with 
controlled flexion and extension. Postaxial polydactyly (the most common form) occurs on the ulnar side of the hand 
and fibular side of the foot. Preaxial polydactyly is present on the radial side of the hand and the tibial side of the 
foot. The majority of conditions are isolated with an autosomal dominant mode of inheritance. Some of them are part 
of a syndrome, usually an autosomal recessive one. Preaxial polydactyly, especially triphalangeal thumb, is most 
likely to be part of a multisystem syndrome. Central polydactyly, which consists of an extra digit (usually hidden 
between the long and the ring finger), is often bilateral and is associated with other hand and foot malformations; it is 
inherited with an autosomal mode of inheritance. 
FETALAKINESIADEFORMATIONSEQUENCE(FADS) 
This is a heterogeneous group of conditions with a birth prevalence of about 1 in 3000. Neurological, muscular, 
connective tissue, and skeletal abnormalities result in multiple joint contractures, including bilateral talipes and fixed 
flexion or extension deformities of the hips, knees, elbows and wrists. 

This sequence includes congenital lethal arthrogryposis, multiple pterygium and Pena–Shokeir syndromes. The 
deformities are usually symmetric and, in most cases, all four limbs are involved. The severity of the deformities 
increases distally in the involved limb, with the hands and feet typically being the most severely affected. The 
condition is commonly associated with polyhydramnios (usually after 25 weeks), narrow chest, micrognathia and 
nuchal edema (or increased nuchal translucency at 10–13+6 weeks).

Features of chromosomal defects 
(With the collaboration of Rosalinde Snijders) 
PHENOTYPIC EXPRESSION 
The commonest chromosomal defects are trisomies 21, 18 or 13, Turner syndrome (45,X), 47,XXX, 47,XXY, 47,XYY 
and triploidy. In the first trimester, a common feature of many chromosomal defects is increased nuchal translucency 
thickness. In later pregnancy, each chromosomal defect has its own syndromal pattern of abnormalities. 
Trisomy 21 
Trisomy 21 is associated with a tendency towards brachycephaly, mild ventriculomegaly, flattening of the face, nuchal 
edema, atrioventricular septal defects, duodenal atresia and echogenic bowel, mild hydronephrosis, shortening of the 
limbs, sandal gap and clinodactyly or mid-phalanx hypoplasia of the fifth finger. 
Trisomy 18 
Trisomy 18 is associated with strawberry-shaped head, choroid plexus cysts, absent corpus callosum, Dandy–Walker 
complex, facial cleft, micrognathia, nuchal edema, heart defects, diaphragmatic hernia, esophageal atresia, 
exomphalos, renal defects, myelomeningocele, growth retardation and shortening of the limbs, radial aplasia, 
overlapping fingers and talipes or rocker bottom feet. 
Trisomy 13 
In trisomy 13, common defects include holoprosencephaly and associated facial abnormalities, microcephaly, cardiac 
and renal abnormalities (often enlarged and echogenic kidneys), exomphalos and postaxial polydactyly. 
Triploidy 
Triploidy, where the extra set of chromosomes is paternally derived, is associated with a molar placenta and the 
pregnancy rarely persists beyond 20 weeks. When there is a double maternal chromosome contribution, the 
pregnancy may persist into the third trimester. The placenta is of normal consistency and the fetus demonstrates 
severe asymmetrical growth retardation. Commonly, there is mild ventriculomegaly, micrognathia, cardiac 
abnormalities, myelomeningocoele, syndactyly, and ‘hitch-hiker’ toe deformity. 
Turner syndrome 
There are two types of this syndrome, the lethal and non-lethal types. The rate of intrauterine lethality between 12 
and 40 weeks is about 75%. The lethal type of Turner syndrome presents with large nuchal cystic hygromata, 
generalized edema, mild pleural effusions and ascites, and cardiac abnormalities. The non-lethal type usually does not 
demonstrate any ultrasonographic abnormalities. 
Sex chromosome abnormalities 
The main sex chromosome abnormalities, other than Turner syndrome, are 47,XXX, 47,XXY and 47,XYY. These are 
not associated with an increased prevalence of sonographically detectable defects. 

Types of abnormalities 
The following table describes the common chromosomal abnormalities in the presence of various sonographically 
detected defects.

RISK FOR CHROMOSSOMAL DEFECTS 
Number of defects 
Ultrasound studies have demonstrated that major chromosomal defects are often associated with multiple fetal 
abnormalities. The overall risk for chromosomal defects increases with the total number of abnormalities that are 
identified. It is therefore recommended that, when an abnormality/marker is detected at routine ultrasound 
examination, a thorough check is made for the other features of the chromosomal defect(s) known to be associated 
with that marker; should additional abnormalities be identified, the risk is dramatically increased.

2 490 11% 
3 220 32% 
4 115 52% 
5 53 66% 
6 40 63% 
7 16 69% 
8 or more 24 92% 
Major defects 
If the 18–23-week scan demonstrates major defects, it is advisable to offer fetal karyotyping even if these defects are 
apparently isolated. The prevalence of these defects is low and therefore the cost implications are small. If the defects 
are either lethal or they are associated with severe handicap, fetal karyotyping constitutes one of a series of 
investigations to determine the possible cause and therefore the risk of recurrence. Examples of these defects include 
hydrocephalus, holoprosencephaly, multicystic renal dysplasia and severe hydrops. In the case of isolated neural tube 
defects, there is controversy as to whether the risk for chromosomal defects is increased. Similarly, for skeletal 
dysplasias where the likely diagnosis is obvious by ultrasonography, it would probably be unnecessary to perform 
karyotyping. If the defect is potentially correctable by intrauterine or postnatal surgery, it may be logical to exclude 
an underlying chromosomal abnormality, especially because for many of these conditions the usual abnormality is 
trisomy 18 or 13. Examples include facial cleft, diaphragmatic hernia, esophageal atresia, exomphalos and many of 
the cardiac defects. In the case of isolated gastroschisis or small bowel obstruction, there is no evidence of increased 
risk of trisomies. 
Minor defects or markers 
For apparently isolated abnormalities, there are large differences in the reported incidence of associated chromosomal 
defects. It is therefore uncertain whether, in such cases, karyotyping should be undertaken, especially for those 
abnormalities that have a high prevalence in the general population and for which the prognosis in the absence of a 
chromosomal defect is good. Since the incidence of chromosomal defects is associated with maternal age, it is 
possible that the wide range of results reported in the various studies is the mere consequence of differences in the 
maternal age distribution of the populations examined. In addition, since chromosomal abnormalities are associated 
with a high rate of intrauterine death, differences may arise from the fact that studies were undertaken at different 
stages of pregnancy. For example, to determine whether apparently isolated choroid plexus cysts at 20 weeks of 
gestation are associated with an increased risk for trisomy 18, it is essential to know the incidence of trisomy 18 at 20 
weeks, based on the maternal age distribution of the population that is examined. Therefore, we propose that, in the 
calculation of risks for chromosomal defects, it is necessary to take into account ultrasound findings as well as the 
maternal age and the gestational age at the time of the scan . 

Association with maternal age and gestation 
The risk for trisomies increases with maternal age and decreases with gestation; the rate of intrauterine lethality 
between 12 weeks and 40 weeks is about 30% for trisomy 21, and 80% for trisomies 18 and 13 (Appendix 1). Turner 
syndrome is usually due to loss of the paternal X chromosome and, consequently, the frequency of conception of 45,X 
embryos, unlike that of trisomies, is unrelated to maternal age. The prevalence is about 1 per 1500 at 12 weeks, 1 
per 3000 at 20 weeks and 1 per 4000 at 40 weeks. For the other sex chromosome abnormalities (47,XXX, 47,XXY 
and 47,XYY), there is no significant change with maternal age and, since the rate of intrauterine lethality is not higher 
than in chromosomally normal fetuses, the overall prevalence (about 1 per 500) does not decrease with gestation. 
Polyploidy affects about 2% of recognized conceptions but it is highly lethal and it is very rarely observed in live 
births; the prevalence at 12 and 20 weeks is about 1 per 2000 and 1 per 250 000, respectively. 
Type of defect 
If there are minor defects, the risk for trisomy 21 is calculated by multiplying the background (maternal age-and 
gestation-related risk) by a factor depending on the specific defect. For the following conditions, there are sufficient 
data in the literature to estimate the risk factors. 
Nuchal edema or fold more than 6 mm This is the second-trimester form of nuchal translucency. It is found in 
about 0.5% of fetuses and it may be of no pathological significance. However, it is sometimes associated with 
chromosomal defects, cardiac anomalies, infection or genetic syndromes. For isolated nuchal edema, the risk for 
trisomy 21 may be ten-times the background risk. 
Hyperechogenic bowel This is found in about 0.5% of fetuses and is usually of no pathological significance. The 
commonest cause is intra-amniotic bleeding, but occasionally it may be a marker of cystic fibrosis or chromosomal 
defects. For isolated hyperechogenic bowel, the risk for trisomy 21 may be seven-times the background risk. 

Short femur If the femur is below the 5th centile and all other measurements are normal, the baby is likely to be 
normal but rather short. Rarely, this is a sign of dwarfism. Occasionally, it may be a marker of chromosomal defects. 
On the basis of existing studies, short femur is found four-times as commonly in trisomy 21 fetuses compared to 
normal fetuses. However, there is some evidence that isolated short femur may not be more common in trisomic than 
normal fetuses. 
Echogenic foci in the heart These are found in about 4% of pregnancies and they are usually of no pathological 
significance. However, they are sometimes associated with cardiac defects and chromosomal abnormalities. For 
isolated hyperechogenic foci, the risk for trisomy 21 may be three-times the background risk. 
Choroid plexus cysts These are found in about 1–2% of pregnancies and they are usually of no pathological 
significance. When other defects are present, there is a high risk of chromosomal defects, usually trisomy 18 but 
occasionally trisomy 21. For isolated choroid plexus cysts, the risk for trisomy 18 and trisomy 21 is 1.5-times the 
background risk. 

Mild hydronephrosis This is found in about 1–2% of pregnancies and is usually of no pathological significance. 
When other abnormalities are present, there is a high risk of chromosomal defects, usually trisomy 21. For isolated 
mild hydronephrosis, the risk for trisomy 21 is 1.5-times the background risk.

Fetaltumors 
(With the collaboration of Israel Goldstein) 
INTRODUCTION 
Fetal tumors are rare, but they have important implications for the health of both the fetus and the mother. The 
natural history and prognosis of most fetal tumors are well known. Once a fetal tumor has been detected, close 
surveillance by a multidisciplinary team of doctors is mandatory, with anticipation and early recognition of problems 
during pregnancy, labor and immediate postnatal life. When the sonographic diagnosis is uncertain, fetal tissue biopsy 
may be necessary to obtain a histological diagnosis. In rare cases, intrauterine treatment may be possible. Some fetal 
tumors may be malignant and could metastasize to other fetal organs and the placenta; maternal metastases in such 
cases are unknown. In contrast, on rare occasions, maternal malignancies (melanoma, leukemia and breast cancer) 
can metastasize to the placenta; in about half of the cases with placental metastases, mostly with malignant 
melanoma, the tumor can metastasize to fetal viscera. 
Etiology and mechanisms of carcinogenesis 
Developmental errors during embryonic and fetal maturation may result in embryonic tumors. One hypothesis is that 
more cells are produced than are required for the formation of an organ or tissue and the origins of embryonic tumors 
rest in developmental errors in these surplus embryonic rudiments. Embryonic tumors developing after infancy are 
explained by the persistence of cell rests or developmental vestiges. Developmentally anomalous tissue (such as 
hamartomas and dysgenic gonads) is a source of neoplasms in older children and adults. When any of this 
developmentally abnormal tissue is present at birth, it is inferred that the cells failed to mature, migrate or 
differentiate properly during intrauterine life. 
Neoplastic transformation of cells in tissue culture and in vivo carcinogenesis are dynamic, multistep and complex 
processes that can be separated artificially into three phases: initiation, promotion and progression. These phases 
may be applied to the natural history of virtually all human tumors, including embryonic ones. Initiation is the result 
of exposure of cells or tissues to an appropriate dose of a carcinogen; an initiated cell is permanently damaged and 
has a malignant potential. The initiated cells can persist for months or years before becoming malignant. During the 
promotion phase, initiated cells clonally expand. Promotion may be modulated or reversed by a variety of 
environmental conditions. In the last phase, progression, the transformed cells develop into a tumor, ultimately with 
metastasis. Embryonic tumors can, therefore, be regarded as defects in the integrated control of cell differentiation 
and proliferation. A genetic model of carcinogenesis has also been introduced in an attempt to clarify the 
pathogenesis and behavioral peculiarities of certain embryonic tumors. According to this hypothesis, embryonal 
neoplasms arise as a result of two mutational events in the genome. The first mutation is prezygotic in familial cases 
and postzygotic in non-familial; the second mutation is always postzygotic. 
Benignity of fetal and infantile neoplasms 
Some neonatal and infantile tumors have a benign clinical behavior despite histological evidence of malignancy. 
Examples include congenital neuroblastomas and hepatoblastomas in the first year of life, and congenital and infantile 
fibromatosis, and sacrococcygeal teratomas in the first few months of life. The factors responsible for this ‘oncogenic 
period of grace’, which starts in utero and extends through the first few months of extrauterine life, are uncertain. 
Association of neoplasia and congenital malformations 
The concept that teratogenesis and oncogenesis have shared mechanisms is well documented by numerous 
examples. Probably, there is simultaneous or sequential cellular and tissue reaction to specific injurious agents. The 
degree of cytodifferentiation, the metabolic or immunological state of the embryo or fetus, and the length of time of 
exposure to the agent will determine whether the effect is teratogenic, oncogenic, both, or neither. Many biological, 

chemical and physical agents known to be teratogenic to the fetus or embryo are carcinogenic postnatally. 
Alternatively, a teratogenic event during intrauterine life may predispose the fetus to an oncogenic event later in life. 
This would explain neoplastic transformation occurring in hamartomas, developmental vestiges, heterotopias and 
dysgenetic tissues. It is postulated that the anomalous tissues harbor latent oncogenes which, under certain 
environmental conditions, are activated, resulting in malignant transformation of a tumor. 
Classification 
A formal classification of fetal tumors does not exist. Apart from distinguishing solid from cystic lesions, probably the 
best classification should be by location. The main compartments of fetal tumors are the head and brain, face and 
neck, thorax (including the heart), abdomen and retroperitoneum, extremities, genitalia, sacrococcygeal region, and 
skin. 
Prenatal diagnosis 
The approach for prenatal diagnosis of fetal tumors should be based on three sets of ultrasound signs: general signs, 
organ-specific signs and tumor-specific signs. The general sonographic features, that should raise the suspicion of an 
underlying fetal tumor, include: 
(1) Absence or disruption of contour, shape, location, sonographic texture or size, of a normal anatomic structure; 
(2) Presence of an abnormal structure or abnormal biometry; 
(3) Abnormality in fetal movement; 
(4) Polyhydramnios; and 
(5) Hydrops fetalis. 
Polyhydramnios is particularly important, because almost 50% of fetal tumors are accompanied by this finding. The 
underlying mechanisms include interference with swallowing (such as thyroid goiter or myoblastoma), mechanical 
obstruction (such as gastrointestinal tumors), excessive production of amniotic fluid (such as sacrococcygeal 
teratoma), and decreased resorption by lung tissue in lung pathology. Intracranial tumors are also commonly 
associated with polyhydramnios and the mechanism may be neurogenic lack of swallowing or inappropriate polyuria. 
Tumor-specific signs include pathological changes within the tumor mass (calcifications, liquefaction, organ edema, 
internal bleeding, neovascularization and rapid changes in size and texture). Organ-specific signs are rare, but in 
some cases they are highly suggestive of the condition (such as cardiomegaly with a huge solid or cystic mass 
occupying the entire heart, suggesting intrapericardial teratoma). 
In some cases, normal and abnormal sonographic findings may mimic fetal tumors. Examples may vary from severe 
cases of bladder exstrophy (where the protruding bladder mass appears as a solid tumor-like structure), to rare cases 
of fetal scrotal inguinal hernia (where bowel loops occupy the scrotum, appearing as huge masses). 
Prognosis 
Apart from intracranial tumors (where the prognosis is generally poor), the prognosis for tumors in other locations is 
variable and depends on the size of the tumor (with resultant compression of adjacent organs), degree of 
vascularization (with the risk of causing heart failure and hydrops), and associated polyhydramnios (with the risk of 
preterm delivery). 
INTRACRANIALTUMORS 
Intracranial tumors include teratomas, epidermoid, dermoid, germinoma, medulloblastoma, meningeal sarcoma, 
lipoma of the corpus callosum, oligodendroglioma, gangliocytoma, and glioblastoma, choroid plexus papilloma, 
tuberous sclerosis (Bourneville’s disease), neurofibromatosis (Von Recklinghausen’s disease), and systemic 
angiomatosis of the central nervous system and eye (Von Hippel–Lindau’s disease). 

Prevalence 
Brain tumors are exceedingly rare in children, and only about 5% arise during fetal life; teratoma is the most 
frequently reported. 
Etiology 
Embryonic tumors are thought to derive from embryologically displaced cells. Brain tumors have been produced in 
animals by the use of chemical and viral teratogens. The relevance of these experiments to human brain neoplasms is 
unclear. 
Diagnosis 
A brain tumor should be suspected in the presence of mass-occupying lesions (cystic or solid areas), and a change in 
shape or size of the normal anatomic structures (such as shift in the mid-line). Cystic tumors and teratomas are 
usually characterized by complete loss of the normal intracranial architecture. In some cases, the lesion appears as a 
low echogenic structure, and it may be difficult to recognize. Hydrocephalus is frequently associated with brain tumors 
and may be the presenting sign. The ultrasound appearances of all intracranial tumors are similar and, therefore, 
precise histological diagnosis from a scan is almost impossible. Possible exceptions are lipomas (that have a typical 
hyperechogenic homogeneous appearance) and choroid plexus papillomas (that appear as an overgrowth of the 
choroid plexus). Identification of brain neoplasm associated with tuberous sclerosis, neurofibromatosis, and systemic 
angiomatosis of the central nervous system and eye can be attempted in patients at high risk; in most cases, 
however, antenatal sonography is negative, at least in the second trimester. 
Prognosis 
Prognosis depends on a number of factors, including the histological type and the size and location of the lesion. 
Congenital intracranial teratomas are usually fatal. The limited experience with the other neoplasms in prenatal 
diagnosis precludes the formulation of prognostic considerations. 
TUMORSOFTHEFACEANDNECK 
Epignathus 
This is a very rare teratoma arising from the oral cavity or pharynx. Most cases of epignathus arise from the sphenoid 
bone. Some arise from the hard and soft palate, the pharynx, the tongue and jaw. From their sites of origin, the 
tumors grow into the oral or nasal cavity or intracranially. The tumors, which are usually benign, consist of tissues 
derived from any of the three germinal layers; most of them contain adipose tissue, cartilage, bone, and nervous 
tissue. Prenatal diagnosis is suggested by the demonstration of a solid tumor arising from the oral cavity; 
calcifications and cystic components may also be present. Differential diagnosis includes neck teratomas, 
encephaloceles, and other tumors of the facial structures. Polyhydramnios (due to pharyngeal compression) is usually 
present. A careful examination of the brain is important because the tumor may grow intracranially. The outlook 
depends on the size of the lesion and the involvement of vital structures. Lesions detected antenatally have been very 
large. Polyhydramnios has been associated with poor prognosis. The major cause of neonatal death is asphyxia due to 

airway obstruction. Surgical resection with a normal postoperative course is possible. 
Myoblastoma 
This is a very rare benign tumor, which usually arises from the oral cavity. The tumor occurs in females exclusively 
and it may be the consequence of excessive production of estrogens by the fetal ovaries under human chorionic 
gonadotropin stimulation. The ultrasound features are those of a large solid mass protruding from the fetal mouth. 
Vascular connections between the tumor and the floor of the oral cavity may be demonstrated using color Doppler 
ultrasound. Polyhydramnios (due to pharyngeal compression) is common. 
Cervical teratoma 
This is a rare tumor. Ultrasound features include a unilateral and well-demarcated partly solid and cystic, or 
multiloculated mass, calcifications (in about 50% of cases), and polyhydramnios (in about 30% of cases due to 
esophageal obstruction). The prognosis is very poor and the intrauterine or neonatal mortality rate (due to airway 
obstruction) is about 80%. Survival after surgery is more than 80% but, since these tumors tend to be large, 
extensive neck dissection and multiple additional procedures are necessary to achieve complete resection of the 
tumor with acceptable functional and cosmetic results. 
Goiter 
Fetal goiter (enlargement of the thyroid gland) can be associated with hyperthyroidism (the result of iodine excess or 
deficiency, intrauterine exposure to antithyroid drugs or congenital metabolic disorders of thyroid synthesis), 
hypothyroidism or an euthyroid state. Ultrasound diagnosis is based on the demonstration of a solid, anteriorly 
located symmetric mass, which may result in hyperextension of the fetal head. Polyhydramnios is common due to 
mechanical obstruction of the esophagus. The prognosis depends on the basic cause of the goiter. Most cases are in 
women with a history of thyroid disease. Fetal blood sampling can aid in determining fetal thyroid status, especially in 
women suffering from Grave’s disease where a transplacental transfer of drugs or thyroid-stimulating antibodies may 
result in fetal goiter. Maternal therapy usually corrects fetal hyperthyroidism. Direct fetal therapy in cases of fetal 
hypothyroidism can be undertaken by amniocentesis or by cordocentesis and this can result in resolution of the fetal 
goiter. 

TUMORSOFTHETHORAX 
Lung tumors 
Fetal lung tumors have not been reported in the literature. Other lesions, which are malformations, and which may 
appear as solid masses in the thorax, include cystic adenoid malformation of lung and extralobar lung sequestration. 
Mediastinal tumors 
Mediastinal tumors (which include neuroblastoma and hemangioma) may cause mediastinal shift, lung hypoplasia, 
hydrops and polyhydramnios (due to esophageal compression). 
Rhabdomyoma (hamartoma) of the heart 
Rhabdomyoma (which represents excessive growth of cardiac muscle) is the most common primary cardiac tumor in 
the fetus, neonate, and young child; the birth prevalence is 1 per 10 000. In 50% of cases, the tumor is associated 
with tuberous sclerosis (autosomal dominant condition with a high degree of penetrance and variable expressivity). 
The ultrasound features are those of a single or multiple echogenic masses impinging upon the cardiac cavities. The 
prognosis depends on the number, size and location of the tumors. The clinical spectrum varies from completely 
asymptomatic to severely ill. The mortality rate in infants operated on within the first year of life is about 30%. Up to 
80% of the infants with tuberous sclerosis have seizures and mental retardation, which are the most serious long-
term complications of the disease. 
Intrapericardial teratoma 
In the majority of cases, the tumor is located in the right side of the heart. It may reach a size that is 2–3 times that 
of the normal heart. The tumor may be cystic or pedunculated. Pericardial effusion is always present and results from 
rupture of cystic areas within the tumor, or from obstruction of cardiac and pericardial lymphatic veins. Cardiac 
tamponade and hydrops may develop and the prognosis is very poor. 
TUMORSOFTHEABDOMENANDRETROPERITONEUM 
Hepatic tumors 
Primary hepatic tumors (hemangioma, mesenchymal hamartoma, hepatoblastoma and adenoma) are extremely rare. 
All hepatic tumors may show the same sonographic features: either a defined lesion (cystic or solid) is present or 
hepatomegaly exists. Calcifications may appear, and both oligohydramnios and polyhydramnios have been observed. 
The other tumors are very rare and little is known about their natural history. Hemangiomata are histologically benign 
and they regress spontaneously after infancy. However, occasionally, they are associated with arteriovenous 
shunting, congestive heart failure and hydrops, resulting in intrauterine or neonatal death. 

Neuroblastoma 
This is one of the most common tumors of infancy and is found in about 1 per 20 000 births. Neuroblastoma arises 
from undifferentiated neural tissue of the adrenal medulla or sympathetic ganglia in the abdomen, thorax, pelvis, or 
head and neck. Usually, the lesion is isolated, but occasional metastasis before birth may occur. Sonographically, the 
tumor appears as a cystic, solid, or complex mass in the region of the adrenal gland (directly above the level of the 
kidney and under the diaphragm). Occasionally, calcifications are present. Tumors arising from the sympathetic 
ganglia may appear in the neck, chest, or in the abdomen. There may be associated polyhydramnios and fetal 
hydrops. The tumor can metastasize in utero (placenta, liver, or blood vessels). The prognosis is excellent if the 
diagnosis is made in utero or in the first year of life (survival more than 90%), but, for those diagnosed after the first 
year, survival is less than 20%. 
Renal tumors 
Mesoblastic nephroma (renal hamartoma) is the most frequent renal tumor, while Wilms’ tumor (nephroblastoma) is 
extremely rare. The sonographic picture in both tumors is of a solitary mass replacing the normal architecture of the 
kidney, and, in most cases, there is associated polyhydramnios. Cystic areas may appear in both tumors. Mesoblastic 
nephromas are benign, and nephrectomy is curative in the majority of cases. Wilms’ tumor is a genetically 
heterogeneous group of malignant tumors and up to 60% of affected cases are associated with genetic syndromes 
(such as Beckwith–Wiedemann syndrome). Treatment of the tumor requires surgery, chemotherapy and sometimes 
radiotherapy. 
TUMORSOFTHEEXTREMITIES 
Tumors of the extremities include: 
(1) Vascular hamartosis; a malformation in which newly formed vessels proliferate; 
(2) Hemangioma, a combined lesion of both skin and internal organs. The Klippel–Weber–Trenaunay syndrome should 
be considered in the differential diagnosis. The hemangiomas may vary in size and location. Some authors do not 
consider them to be true tumors, but rather suspect them to represent vascular malformations; 
(3) Lymphangioma, a cavernous lymphangioma, which involves the lymphatic vessels and is related to cystic 
hygroma; 
(4) Sarcoma (mainly rhabdomyosarcoma); this should be distinguished from infantile myofibromatosis. 
TUMORSOFTHESKIN 
Malignant melanoma is a rare tumor capable of metastasizing into other organs including the fetal liver, lungs and 
placenta. 
SACROCOCCYGEALTERATOMA 
The sacrococcygeal region is the most frequent site of teratomas of the fetus. 
Prevalence 
Sacrococcygeal teratoma is found in about 1 per 40 000 births. Females are four times more likely to be affected than 
males, but malignant change is more common in males. 
Etiology 
This tumor is thought to arise from totipotential cells in Hensen’s node. A theory of ‘twinning accident’ with 
incomplete separation during embryogenesis has also been proposed. The condition is sporadic but some cases are 
familial, with autosomal dominant inheritance. 

Diagnosis 
Sacrococcygeal teratomas usually appear solid or mixed solid and cystic (multiple cysts are irregular in shape and 
size). Occasionally, the tumor is completely cystic, and more rarely completely solid. Most teratomas are extremely 
vascular, which is easily shown using color Doppler ultrasound. The tumors may be entirely external, partially internal 
and partly external, or mainly internal. Polyhydramnios is frequent, and this may be due to direct transudation into 
the amniotic fluid and due to fetal polyuria, secondary to the hyperdynamic circulation, which is the consequence of 
arteriovenous shunting. Similarly, high-output heart failure leading to hepatomegaly, placentomegaly and hydrops 
fetalis can occur. 
Prognosis 
Sacrococcygeal teratoma is associated with a high perinatal mortality (about 50%), mainly due to the preterm 
delivery (the consequence of polyhydramnios) of a hydropic infant requiring major neonatal surgery. Difficult surgery, 
especially with tumors that extend into the pelvis and abdomen, can result in nerve injury and incontinence. The 
tumor is invariably benign in the neonatal period but delayed surgery or incomplete excision can result in malignant 
transformation (about 10% before 2 months of age to about 80% by 4 months).

Hydropsfetalis 
HYDROPSFETALIS 
Hydrops is defined by abnormal accumulation of serous fluid in skin (edema) and body cavities (pericardial, pleural, or 
ascitic effusions). 
Prevalence 
Hydrops fetalis is found in about 1 per 2,000 births. 
Etiology 
Hydrops is a non-specific finding in a wide variety of fetal and maternal disorders, including hematological, 
chromosomal, cardiovascular, renal, pulmonary, gastrointestinal, hepatic and metabolic abnormalities, congenital 
infection, neoplasms and malformations of the placenta or umbilical cord. Hydrops is classically devided into immune 
(due to maternal hemolytic antibodies) and non-immune (due to all other etiologies). With the widespread 
introduction of immunoprophylaxis and the successfull treatment of Rhesus disease by fetal blood transfusions, non-
immune causes have become responsible for at least 75% of the cases, and make a greater contribution to perinatal 
mortality. While in many instances the underlying cause may be determined by maternal antibody and infection 
screening, fetal ultrasound scanning, including echocardiography and Doppler studies, and fetal blood sampling, quite 
often the abnormality remains unexplained even after expert post-mortem examination. 
Prognosis 
Although isolated ascites, both in fetuses and neonates, may be transitory, the spontaneous resolution of hydrops has 
not been reported and the overall mortality for this condition is about 80%.

Fetaltherapy 
Immune hydrops can be successfully treated by blood transfusions to the fetus. Such treatment often results in 
reversal of hydrops and the survival rate is about 80%. Fetal therapy can also successfully reverse some types of 
non-immune hydrops, such as fetal tachyarrhythmias (by transplacental or direct fetal administration of 
antiarrhythmic drugs), pleural effusions (by pleuro-amniotic shunting), urinary ascites (by vesico-amniotic or 
peritoneal-amniotic shunting), parvovirus B19 infection or severe fetomaternal hemorrhage (by fetal blood 
transfusions), diaphragmatic hernia, cystic adenomatoid malformation of the lungs and sacrococcygeal teratoma (by 
open fetal surgery), and the recipient fetus in twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome (by endoscopic laser coagulation of 
the communicating placental vessels).

Smallforgestationalage 
SMALLFORGESTATIONALAGE 
Small for gestational age fetuses are defined by the finding that the abdominal circumference is below the 5th centile 
for gestation. About 80% of such fetuses are constitutionally small, with no increased perinatal death or morbidity, 
15% are growth restricted due to reduced placental perfusion and "utero-placental insufficiency", and 5% are growth 
restricted due to low growth potential, the result of genetic disease or enviromental damage. 
Ultrasound findings 
The finding of a small abdominal circumference should stimulate the sonographer to consider four possible causes: 
wrong dates, normal small, abnormal small or starving small fetus. Accurate measurements of the head and 
abdominal circumference, femur length and transverse cerebellar diameter should be taken and their various ratios 
should be examined. Additionally, a detailed examination should be carried out for the detection of any defects or 
markers of chromosomal abnormalities (mainly triploidy and trisomy 18), and for assessment of amniotic fluid and 
fetal activity. 
BPD/OFD/HC TCD 
AC FL 

In cases of wrong dates, there may be a suggestive history (uncertain last menstrual period, irregular cycle, 
conception within three months of stopping the contraceptive pill or breast feeding), all measurements symmetrically 
small, no obvious anatomical defects, normal amniotic fluid volume and fetal activity. A repeat ultrasound 
examination in two weeks will demonstrate an increase in fetal measurements and the rate of growth is normal (the 
lines joining the measurements are parallel to the appropriate normal mean for gestation). 
In normal small fetuses, the mother is usually small (the main determinant of fetal size is maternal size), and the 
ultrasound findings are similar to pregnancies with wrong dates. However, a repeat scan in two weeks may 
demonstrate a further deviation from normal in the various fetal measurements. 
In starving small fetuses, the fetal measurements demonstrate asymmetry (the greatest deficit is observed in the 
abdominal circumference, then the femur length and finally the head circumference with the transverse cerebellar 
diameter being the least affected), there are no obvious fetal anatomical defects, the amniotic fluid and fetal 
movements are reduced, the placenta is often thickened with translucent areas (placental lakes) and there are 
abnormal Doppler waveforms in the uterine and / or umbilical arteries. 
In abnormal small fetuses there may be anatomical defects suggestive of chromosomal abnormalities (in triploidy 
there may be a molar placenta or in the presence of a normal placenta the fetus demonstrates severe asymmetrical 
growth retardation, mild ventriculomegaly, micrognathia, cardiac abnormalities, myelomeningocoele, syndactyly, or 
'hitch-hiker' toe deformity; trisomy is characterised by strawberry-shaped head, choroid plexus cysts, absent corpus 
callosum, enlarged cisterna magna, facial cleft, micrognathia, nuchal oedema, heart defects, diaphragmatic hernia, 
oesophageal atresia, exomphalos, renal defects, myelomeningocoele, growth retardation and shortening of the limbs, 
radial aplasia, overlapping fingers and talipes or rocker bottom feet). The amniotic fluid may be normal decreased or 
often increased. In congenital infection growth retardation may be associated with features of hydrops and brain 
abnormalities (ventriculomegaly, microcephaly or cerebral calcifications). 
Doppler ultrasound 
Doppler ultrasound provides a non-invasive method for the study of fetal haemodynamics. Investigation of the uterine 
and umbilical arteries provide information on the perfusion of the utero-placental and feto-placental circulations 
respectively, while Doppler studies of selected fetal organs are valuable in detecting the hemodynamic 
rearrangements that occur in response to fetal hypoxaemia. In normal pregnancy, impedance to flow in the uterine 
artery decreases with gestation and this presumably reflects the trophoblastic invasion of the spiral arteries and their 
conversion into low resistance vessels. Similarly, there is a decrease in impedance to flow in the umbilical arteries due 
to progressive maturation of the placenta and increase in the number of tertiary stem villi.

Severe fetal hypoxemia there is decompenation in the cardiovascular system and 
right heart failure 
Peripheral vasoconstriction, as seen in fetal redistribution, causes an increase in 
ventricular afterload and thus ventricular end diastolic pressure increases. This 
results in retrograde blood flow in IVC with increase velocity in atrial contraction. 
Umbilcal vein pulsations are also observed in severe hypoxia. 
In severe fetal hypoxemia there is decompenation in the cardiovascular system and 
right heart failure. This is manifested by the absence or reversal of forward flow 
during atrial contraction in the ductus venosus and this is a sign of impending fetal 
death. 

In constitutionally small fetuses Doppler studies of the placental and fetal circulations are normal. Similarly in growth 
restricted fetuses due to genetic disease the results are often normal. In growth restriction due to placental 
insufficiency there is increased impedance to flow in the uterine arteries (with the characteristic waveform of early 
diastolic notching) and umbilical arteries (high pulsatility index and in severe cases absence of reversal of end 
diastolic frequencies). These data support the findings from histopathologic studies that in this condition there is 
failure of the normal development of maternal placental arteries into low resistance vessels (and therefore reduced 
oxygen and nutrient supply to the intervillous space), and reduction in the number of placental terminal capillaries 
and small muscular arteries in the tertiary stem villi (and therefore impaired maternal-fetal transfer). 
Doppler studies of the fetal circulation demonstrate decrease in impedance to flow in the middle cerebral arteries and 
increase in impedance in the descending thoracic aorta and renal artery. These findings suggest that in fetal 
hypoxemia there is an increase in the blood supply to the brain and reduction in the perfusion of the kidneys, gastro-
intestinal tract and the lower extremities. Although knowledge of the factors governing circulatory readjustments and 
their mechanism of action is incomplete, it appears that partial pressures of oxygen and carbon dioxide play a role, 
presumably through their action on chemoreceptors. In severe fetal hypoxemia there is decompenation in the 
cardiovascular system and right heart failure. This is manifested by the absence or reversal of forward flow during 
atrial contraction in the ductus venosus and this is a sign of impending fetal death. 
Chromosomal defects 
Although low birth weight is a common feature of many chromosomal abnormalities, the incidence of chromosomal 
defects in small for gestational age neonates is less than 1-2%. However, data derived from postnatal studies 
underestimate the association between chromosomal abnormalitites and growth retardation, since many pregnancies 
with chromosomally abnormal fetuses result in intrauterine death. Thus in fetuses presenting with growth retardation 
in the second trimester the incidence of chromosomal abnormalities is 10-20%. The chromosomal abnormalities 
associated with severe growth restriction are triploidy, trisomy 18 and deletion of the short arm of chromosome 4. 
The incidence of chromosomal defects is much higher in (a) fetuses with multiple malformations, than in those with 
no structural defects, (b) the group with normal or increased amniotic fluid volume, than in those with reduced or 
absent amniotic fluid, and (c) in the group with normal waveforms from both uterine and umbilical arteries, than in 
those with abnormal waveforms from either or both vessels. A substantial proportion of the chromosomally abnormal 
fetuses demonstrate the asymmetry (high head to abdomen circumference ratio), thought to be typical for 
uteroplacental insufficiency; indeed the most severe form of asymmetrical growth retardation is found in fetuses with 
triploidy. 
Growth restriction can also be caused by confined placental mosaicism. In this condition, which is found in about 1% 
of pregnancies, the fetal karyotype is normal but there are two different chromosomal complements in the placenta 
(one is usually normal and the other an autosomal trisomy). Placental mosaicism is also associated with uniparental 
disomy (inheritance of two homologous chromosomes from one parent), which often results in growth restriction.

Chapter14 
Abnormalities of the amniotic fluid volume
Amniotic fluid is produced by fetal urination but in the first 16 weeks of gestation additional sources include the 
placenta, amniotic membranes, umbilical cord and fetal skin. Removal of amniotic fluid is by fetal swallowing. 
Ultrasonographically, the diagnosis of polyhydramnios or oligohydramnios is made when there is excessive or virtual 
absence of echo-free spaces around the fetus. 
OLIGOHYDRAMNIOS/ANHYDRAMNIOS 
Oligohydramnios means reduced amniotic fluid and anhydramnios means absence of amniotic fluid. 
Prevalence 
Oligohydramnios in the second trimester is found in about 1 per 500 pregnancies. 
Etiology 
Oligohydramnios in the second trimester is usually the result of preterm premature rupture of the membranes, 
uteroplacental insufficiency and urinary tract malformations (bilateral renal agenesis, multicystic or polycystic 
kidneys, or urethral obstruction). 
Diagnosis 
The diagnosis of oligohydramnios is usually made subjectively. 
Quantitative criteria include: 
(a) the largest single pocket of amniotic fluid being 1 cm or less, or 
(b) amniotic fluid index (the sum of the vertical measurements of the largest pockets of amniotic fluid in the four 
quadrants of the uterus) of less than 5 cm. 
Anecoic areas simulating pockets of amniotic fluid Color Doppler energy at the umbilical cord 
In the absence of the "accoustic window" normally provided by the amniotic fluid, and the "undesirable" postures 
often adopted by these fetuses, confident exclusion of fetal defects may be impossible. Nevertheless, the detection of 
a dilated blader in urethral obstruction and enlarged echogenic or multicystic kidneys in renal disease should be 
relatively easy. The main difficulty is in the differential diagnosis of renal agenesis. In cases of preterm prelabour 

rupture of the membranes, detailed questioning of the mother may reveal a history of chronic leakage of amniotic 
fluid. Furthermore, in uteroplacental insufficiency, Doppler blood flow studies will often demomstrate high impedance 
to flow in the placental circulation and redistribution in the fetal circulation. In the remaining cases, intra-amniotic 
instillation of normal saline may help improve ultrasonographic examination and lead to the diagnosis of fetal 
abnormalities like renal agenesis. 
Prognosis 
Bilateral renal agenesis, multicystic or polycystic kidneys are lethal abnormalities, usually in the neonatal period due 
to pulmonary hypoplasia. Preterm rupture of membranes at 20 weeks or earlier is associated with a poor prognosis; 
about 40% miscarry within five days of membrane rupture due to chorioamnionitis and in the remaining 60% of 
pregnancies more than 50% of neonates die due to pulmonary hypoplasia. Uteroplacental insufficiency resulting in 
oligohydramnios at 18-23 weeks is very severe and the most likely outcome is intrauterine death. 
POLYHYDRAMNIOS 
Polyhydramnios means increased or excessive amniotic fluid volume. 
Prevalence 
Polyhydramnios in the second trimester is found in about 1 per 200 pregnancies. 
Etiology 
There are essentially two major causes of polyhydramnios; reduced fetal swallowing or absorption of amniotic fluid 
and increased fetal urination. Reduced fetal swallowing may be due to craniospinal defects (such as anencephaly), 
facial tumours, gastrointestinal obstruction (such as esophageal atresia, duodenal atresia and small bowel 
obstruction), compressive pulmonary disorders (such as pleural effusions, diaphragmatic hernia or cystic adenomatoid 
malformation of the lungs), narrow thoracic cage (due to skeletal dysplasias), and fetal akinesia deformation 
sequence (due to neuromascular impairement of fetal swallowing). Increased fetal urination is observed in maternal 
diabetes mellitus and maternal uremia (increased glucose and urea cause osmotic diuresis), hyperdynamic fetal 
circulation due to fetal anemia (due to red cell isoimmunization or congenital infection) or fetal and placental tumours 
or cutaneous arteriovenous malformations (such as sacrococcygeal teratoma, placental chorioangioma), or twin-to 
twin transfusion syndrome. 
Diagnosis 
The diagnosis of polyhydramnios is usually made subjectively. Quantitatively, polyhydramnios is defined as an 
amniotic fluid index (the sum of the vertical measurements of the largest pockets of amniotic fluid in the four 
quadrants of the uterus) of 20 cm or more. Alternatively, the vertical measurement of the largest single pocket of 
amniotic fluid free of fetal parts is used to classify polyhydramnios into mild (8-11 cm), moderate (12-15 cm) and 
severe (16 cm or more). Although 80% of cases with mild polyhydramnios are considered to be idiopathic, in the 
majority of cases with moderate or severe polyhydramnios there are maternal or fetal disorders. In most cases 
polyhydramnios develops late in the second or in the third trimester of pregnancy. Acute polyhydramnios at 18-23 
weeks is mainly seen in association with twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome. Testing for maternal diabetes, detailed 
sonographic examination for anomalies, and fetal karyotyping should constitute the cornerstones of the diagnostic 
protocol in the investigation of these cases. 

-Moderate polyhydramnios Polyhydramnios Diaphragmatic Hernia 
Prenataltherapy 
The aim is to reduce the risk of very premature delivery and the maternal discomfort that often accompanies severe 
polyhydramnios. Treatment will obviously depend on the diagnosis, and will include better glycemic control of 
maternal diabetes mellitus, antiarrhythmic medication for fetal hydrops due to dysrrhythmias, thoracoamniotic 
shunting for fetal pulmonary cysts or pleural effusions. For the other cases, polyhydramnios may be treated by 
repeated amniocenteses every few days and drainage of large volumes of amniotic fluid. However, the procedure 
itself may precipitate premature labour. An alternative and effective method of treatment is maternal administration 
of indomethacin; however, this drug may cause fetal ductul constriction and close monitoring by serial fetal 
echocardiographic studies is necessary. In twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome, presenting with acute polyhydramnios 
at 18-23 weeks of gestation, endocopic laser occlusion of placental anastomoses or serial amniodrainage may be 
carried out. 
Prognosis 
This depends on the cause of polyhydramnios.

NormalFetalBiometry 
The normal ranges for fetal biometry presented in this section were established from cross-sectional data on 1040 
singleton pregnancies at 14–40 weeks of gestation(Snijders & Nicolaides, Ultrasound Obstet Gynecol 1994;4:34– 
48).The patients fulfilled the following criteria: (1) known last menstrual period with a cycle length of 26–30 days, (2) 
no fetal abnormalities and no pregnancy complications, (3) live birth at term, (4) birth weight above the 3rd and 
below the 97th centile for gestation (Yudkin et al., Early Hum Dev 1987;15:45–52). For each 7-day interval from 14 
to 40 weeks, 40 patients were included. 
Measurements of biparietal diameter (BPD), occipito-frontal diameter (OFD), anterior and posterior cerebral ventricle 
diameter (Va and Vp), and hemisphere (H) were obtained from a transverse axial plane of the fetal head showing a 
central mid-line echo broken in the anterior third by the cavum septii pellucidi and demonstrating the anterior and 
posterior horns of the lateral ventricles. BPD and OFD were measured from the outer borders of the skull and head 
circumference (HC) was calculated [3.14 x(BPD+OFD)/2]. Va was the distance between the lateral wall of the anterior 
horn to the mid-line and Vp was the distance between the medial and lateral walls of the posterior horn. The 
hemisphere was measured from the mid-line to the inner border of the skull. Transverse cerebellar diameter (TCD) 
and cisterna magna diameter (CM) were measured in the suboccipitobregmatic plane of the head. The femur length 
(FL) was measured from the greater trochanter to the lateral condyle. For abdominal circumference (AC), a 
transverse section of the fetal abdomen was taken at the level of the stomach and the bifurcation of the main portal 
vein into its right and left branches. The anteroposterior (AD1) and transverse (AD2) diameters were measured and 
AC was calculated [3.14 x (A)/2]. The following ratios were calculated: HC/AC, HC/FL, Va/H and Vp/H. 
For each of the measurements and their ratios, regression analysis was applied examining linear, quadratic and cubic 
models for the association with gestational age (in days). For those measurements where the standard deviation 
increased or decreased with gestation, logarithmic or square root transformation was applied to stabilize variance. If 
the quadratic or cubic terms did not improve the original linear model (an independent correlation with p < 0.05 and 
improvement of the correlation coefficient), the linear model was chosen as the best fit. Where the quadratic or cubic 
components did improve the model, they were included in the equation for the regression line. Equations for 
regression lines on transformed data were used to calculate the mean and residual SD in transformed units. To 
produce the reference ranges in the original units, the mean and limits of the calculated reference range in 
transformed units were subjected to anti-logarithmic or power transformation as appropriate.
