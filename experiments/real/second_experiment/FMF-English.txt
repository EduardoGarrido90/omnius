Introduction 
In 1866 Langdon Down noted that common characteristics of patients with 
trisomy 21 are skin deficient in elasticity, giving the appearance of being too 
large for the body, and flat face with a small nose. In the 1990s, it was realized 
that the excess skin of individuals with Down’s syndrome can be visualized by 
ultrasonography as increased nuchal translucency in the third month of 
intrauterine life. Fetal nuchal translucency thickness at the 11–13+6 weeks 
scan has been combined with maternal age to provide an effective method of 
screening for trisomy 21; for an invasive testing rate of 5%, about 75% of 
trisomic pregnancies can be identified. When maternal serum free ß-human 
chorionic gonadotropin and pregnancy-associated plasma protein-A at 
11–13+6 weeks are also taken into account, the detection rate of chromosomal 
defects is about 85–90%. In 2001, it was found that in 60–70% of fetuses 
with trisomy 21 the nasal bone is not visible at the 11–13+6 weeks scan and 
examination of the nasal bone can increase the detection rate of screening by 
the first trimester scan and serum biochemistry to more than 95%. 
In addition to its role in the assessment of risk for trisomy 21, increased 
nuchal translucency thickness can also identify a high proportion of other 
chromosomal defects and is associated with major abnormalities of the heart 
and great arteries, and a wide range of genetic syndromes. 
Other benefits of the 11–13+6 weeks scan include confirmation that the 
fetus is alive, accurate dating of the pregnancy, early diagnosis of major fetal 
abnormalities, and the detection of multiple pregnancies. The early scan also 
provides reliable identification of chorionicity, which is the main determinant 
of outcome in multiple pregnancies. 
As with the introduction of any new technology into routine clinical practice, 
it is essential that those undertaking the 11–13+6 weeks scan are adequately 
trained and their results are subjected to rigorous audit. The Fetal Medicine 
Foundation, has introduced a process of training and certification to help to 
establish high standards of scanning on an international basis. The Certificate 
of Competence in the 11–13+6 weeks scan is awarded to those sonographers 
that can perform the scan to a high standard and can demonstrate a good 
knowledge of the diagnostic features and management of the conditions 
identified by this scan.

FIRST TRIMESTER 
DIAGNOSIS OF CHROMOSOMAL DEFECTS 
In 1866, Langdon Down reported that in individuals with 
trisomy 21, the condition that came to bear his name, the skin 
appears to be too large for the body, the nose is small and the face 
is flat. In the last decade it has become possible to observe 
these features by ultrasound examination in the third month of 
intrauterine life. 
About 75% of trisomy 21 fetuses have increased nuchal translucency 
(NT) thickness and 60–70% have absent nasal bone 
(Figures 1 and 2). 
DIAGNOSIS OF CHROMOSOMAL DEFECTS 
Non-invasive diagnosis 
During the last 30 years, extensive research has aimed at developing 
a non-invasive method for prenatal diagnosis based on the 
isolation and examination of fetal cells found in the maternal 
circulation. About 1 in 103–107 nucleated cells in maternal blood 
are fetal. The proportion of fetal cells can be enriched to about 1 
in 10–100 by techniques such as magnetic cell sorting (MACS) 
or fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS) after attachment of 
magnetically labelled or fluorescent antibodies on to specific fetal

cell surface markers. The resulting sample is unsuitable for traditional 
cytogenetic analysis because it is still highly contaminated 
with maternal cells. However, with the use of chromosome-
specific DNA probes and fluorescent in situ hybridization 
(FISH), it is possible to suspect fetal trisomy by the presence of

three-signal nuclei in some of the cells of the maternal blood 
enriched for fetal cells. 
On the basis of currently available technology, examination of 
fetal cells from maternal peripheral blood is more likely to find 
an application as a method for assessment of risk, rather than 
the non-invasive prenatal diagnosis of chromosomal defects. The 
sensitivity of this method is comparable to serum screening. 
However, unlike serum biochemistry testing, which is relatively 
easy to apply for mass population screening, analysis of fetal cells 
from maternal blood is both labor intensive and requires highly 
skilled operators. The extent to which the techniques for enrichment 
of fetal cells could be improved, to achieve a higher yield 
of the necessary cells, as well as become automated, to allow 
simultaneous analysis of a large number of samples, remains to 
be seen. 
Recent interest has focused on the presence of cell-free fetal 
DNA in maternal plasma and the ability to quantify the concentration 
of male fetal DNA in pregnancies with male fetuses using 
real-time quantitative PCR. There is contradictory evidence 
concerning the concentration of cell-free fetal DNA in trisomy 
21 pregnancies with some studies reporting that the levels are 
increased and in others there was no significant difference from 
chromosomally normal pregnancies. The extent to which cell-free 
fetal DNA will become another maternal serum marker in 
screening for trisomy 21 remains to be seen. 
Non-invasive diagnosis 
• Examination of fetal cells from maternal peripheral blood is 
more likely to find an application as a method for assessment 
of risk, rather than the non-invasive prenatal diagnosis of 
chromosomal defects. 
• There is contradictory evidence concerning the concentration 
of cell-free fetal DNA in trisomy 21 pregnancies.

Invasive diagnosis 
Amniocentesis 
There is only one randomized trial which compared the risks of 
amniocentesis to controls. In this study, 4,606 low-risk, healthy 
women, 25–34 years old, at 14–20 weeks of gestation, were 
randomly allocated to amniocentesis or ultrasound examination 
alone (Tabor et al 1986). The total fetal loss rate in the patients 
having amniocentesis was 1% higher than in the controls. The 
study also reported that amniocentesis was associated with an 
increased risk of respiratory distress syndrome and pneumonia. 
Amniocentesis is also possible at 10–14 weeks of gestation. 
However, randomized studies have demonstrated that after early 
amniocentesis the rate of fetal loss is about 2% higher and 
the incidence of talipes equinovarus is 1.6% higher than after 
first-trimester chorionic villus sampling or second-trimester 
amniocentesis. 
Chorionic villus sampling 
Randomized studies have demonstrated that the rate of fetal 
loss following first-trimester transabdominal chorionic villus 
sampling is the same as with second-trimester amniocentesis. 
There is controversy as to whether the rate of fetal loss after 
transcervical chorionic villus sampling is higher or not. 
It is likely that in centres with experience in ultrasound guided 
invasive procedures the risks of amniocentesis and chorionic 
villous sampling, irrespective of route, are the same. 
There is an association between chorionic villus sampling before 
10 weeks and fetal transverse limb abnormalities, micrognathia 
and microglossia. It is therefore imperative that chorionic villus 
The 11–13+6 weeks scan 

sampling is performed only after 11 weeks by appropriately 
trained operators. 
Invasive testing 
•Diagnosis of fetal chromosomal defects requires invasive 
testing. 
•The risk of miscarriage from chorionic villus sampling in the 
first trimester is the same as for amniocentesis in the second 
trimester. 
•Amniocentesis should not be performed before 15 weeks. 
•Chorionic villous sampling should not be performed before 
11 weeks. 
•Invasive tests should be carried out by appropriately trained 
and experienced operators. 
SCREENING FOR CHROMOSOMAL DEFECTS 
In prenatal screening for trisomy 21, the term screen positive rate 
is used interchangeably with the invasive testing rate, because most 
women with a positive screening test undergo an invasive test, 
and with false positive rate (FPR) because the vast majority of 
fetuses in this group are normal. 
The first method of screening for trisomy 21, introduced in the 
early 1970s, was based on the association with advanced maternal 
age. It was apparent that amniocentesis carried a risk of miscarriage 
and this in conjunction with the financial cost implications, 
meant that prenatal diagnosis could not be offered to 
the entire pregnant population. Consequently, amniocentesis was 
initially offered only to women with a minimum age of 40 years. 
Gradually, as the application of amniocentesis became more 
widespread and it appeared to be ‘safe’, the ‘high-risk’ group was 
redefined to include women with a minimum age of 35 years; 
this ‘high-risk’ group constituted 5% of the pregnant population. 
Chapter 1 • First trimester diagnosis of chromosomal defects 

In the last 30 years, two dogmatic policies have emerged in terms 
of screening. The first, mainly observed in countries with private 
healthcare systems, adhered to the dogma of the 35 years of age 
or equivalent risk; since the maternal age of pregnant women has 
increased in most developed countries, the screen-positive group 
now constitute about 15% of pregnancies. The second policy, 
instituted in countries with national health systems, has adhered 
to the dogma of offering invasive testing to the 5% group of 
women with the highest risk; in the last 20 years, the cut-off age 
for invasive testing has therefore increased from 35 to 38 years. 
In screening by maternal age with a cut-off age of 38 years, 5% 
of the population is classified as ‘high risk’ and this group 
contains about 30% of trisomy 21 babies. 
In the late 1980s, a new method of screening was introduced that 
takes into account not only maternal age but also the concentration 
of various fetoplacental products in the maternal circulation. 
At 16 weeks of gestation the median maternal serum concentrations 
of a-fetoprotein (AFP), uconjugated estriol (uE3), human 
chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) (total and free-b) and inhibin-A 
in trisomy 21 pregnancies are sufficiently different from normal 
to allow the use of combinations of some or all of these 
substances to select a ‘high-risk’ group. This method of screening 
is more effective than maternal age alone and, for the same 
rate of invasive testing (about 5%), it can identify about 50–70% 
of the fetuses with trisomy 21. 
In the 1990s, screening by a combination of maternal age and 
fetal NT thickness at 11–13+6 weeks of gestation was introduced. 
This method has now been shown to identify about 75% 
of affected fetuses for a screen-positive rate of about 5%. 
Subsequently, maternal age was combined with fetal NT and 
maternal serum biochemistry (free b-hCG and PAPP-A) in the

first-trimester to identify about 85–90% of affected fetuses. 
Furthermore, the development of new methods of biochemical 
testing, within 30 min of taking a blood sample, made it possible 
to introduce One-Stop Clinics for Assessment of Risk (Figure 3). 
In 2001, it was found that in 60–70% of fetuses with trisomy 21 
the nasal bone is not visible by ultrasound at 11–13+6 weeks and 
preliminary results suggest that this finding can increase the 
detection rate of the first trimester scan and serum biochemistry 
to more than 95% (Table 1). 
PATIENT-SPECIFIC RISK FOR CHROMOSOMAL DEFECTS 
Every woman has a risk that her fetus/baby has a chromosomal 
defect. In order to calculate the individual risk, it is necessary to 
take into account the background or a priori risk, which depends 
on maternal age and gestation, and multiply this by a series of 
factors or likelihood ratios, which depend on the results of a series

screening for trisomy 21. In prenatal screening, the term screen positive rate is used interchangeably with

false positive rate (FPR) because the vast majority of fetuses in this group are normal.

to determine the patient-specific risk. 
The likelihood ratio for a given sonographic or biochemical 
measurement is calculated by dividing the percentage of chromosomally 
abnormal fetuses by the percentage of normal fetuses 
with that measurement. 
Every time a test is carried out the a priori risk is multiplied by 
the likelihood ratio of the test to calculate a new risk, which then 
becomes the a priori risk for the next test (Snijders and 
Nicolaides 1996). This process of sequential screening necessitates 
that the different tests are independent of each other. If the 
tests are not independent of each other then more sophisticated 
techniques, involving multivariate statistics, can be used to 
calculate the combined likelihood ratio. With the introduction of 
OSCAR, the process of sequential screening can all be achieved 
in one session at about 12 weeks of pregnancy (Figure 3).

•Every woman has a risk that her fetus/baby has a chromosomal

•The individual patient-specific risk is calculated by multiplying 
the a priori risk with a series of likelihood ratios, which

•Every time a test is carried out the a priori risk is multiplied by 
the likelihood ratio of the test to calculate a new risk, which 
then becomes the a priori risk for the next test. 
Maternal age and gestation 
The risk for many of the chromosomal defects increases with 
maternal age (Figure 4). Additionally, because fetuses with 
chromosomal defects are more likely to die in utero than normal 
fetuses, the risk decreases with gestational age (Figure 5).

Estimates of the maternal age-related risk for trisomy 21 at birth 
are based on surveys carried out before the introduction of 
prenatal diagnosis (Hecht and Hook 1994). In the last 15 years, 
with the introduction of maternal serum biochemical testing and 
ultrasound screening for chromosomal defects at different stages 
of pregnancy, it has become necessary to establish maternal age 
and gestational age-specific risks for chromosomal defects 
(Snijders et al 1995, 1999). Such estimates were derived by 
comparing, in women of the same age, the prevalence of trisomy 
21 at birth to the prevalence at the time of second-trimester 
amniocentesis or first-trimester chorionic villus sampling. 
The rates of spontaneous fetal death in trisomy 21 between 12 
weeks (when NT screening is carried out) and 40 weeks is about 
30% and between 16 weeks (when second trimester maternal 
serum biochemical testing is carried out) and 40 weeks is about 
20%. 
Similar methods were used to produce estimates of risks for other 
chromosomal defects. The risk for trisomies 18 and 13 increases 
with maternal age and decreases with gestation; the rate of 
The 11–13+6 weeks scan 

miscarriage or fetal death between 12 weeks and 40 weeks is 
about 80% (Table 2). Turner syndrome is usually due to loss of 
the paternal X chromosome and, consequently, the frequency 
of conception of 45,XO embryos, unlike that of trisomies, is 
unrelated to maternal age. The prevalence is about 1 per 1500 at 
12 weeks, 1 per 3000 at 20 weeks and 1 per 4000 at 40 weeks. 
For the other sex chromosome abnormalities (47,XXX, 47,XXY 
and 47,XYY), there is no significant change with maternal age 
and since the rate of fetal death is not higher than in chromosomally 
normal fetuses, the overall prevalence (about 1 per 500) 
does not decrease with gestation. Polyploidy affects about 2% of 
recognized conceptions but it is highly lethal and thus very rarely 
observed in live births; the prevalences at 12 and 20 weeks are 
about 1 per 2000 and 1 per 250 000, respectively. 
Effect of maternal age and gestation on risk 
•The risk for trisomies increases with maternal age. 
•The risk for Turner syndrome and triploidy does not change 
with maternal age. 
•The earlier the gestation, the higher the risk for chromosomal 
defects. 
•The rates of fetal death in trisomy 21 between 12 weeks 
(when NT screening is carried out) and 40 weeks is about 
30% and between 16 weeks (when second trimester maternal 
serum biochemical testing is carried out) and 40 weeks is 
about 20%. 
•In trisomies 18 and 13 and Turner syndrome, the rate of fetal 
death between 12 and 40 weeks is about 80%. 
Previous affected pregnancy 
The risk for trisomies in women who have had a previous fetus 
or child with a trisomy is higher than the one expected on the 
basis of their age alone. In women who had a previous pregnancy 
with trisomy 21, the risk of recurrence in the subsequent

The 11–13+6 weeks scan 

pregnancy is 0.75% higher than the maternal and gestational 
age-related risk for trisomy 21 at the time of testing. Thus, for a 
woman aged 35 years who has had a previous baby with trisomy 
21, the risk at 12 weeks of gestation increases from 1 in 249 
(0.40%) to 1 in 87 (1.15%), and, for a woman aged 25 years, it 
increases from 1 in 946 (0.106%) to 1 in 117 (0.856%). 
The possible mechanism for this increased risk is that a small 
proportion (less than 5%) of couples with a previously affected 
pregnancy have parental mosaicism or a genetic defect that interferes 
with the normal process of dysjunction, so in this group the 
risk of recurrence is increased substantially. In the majority of 
couples (more than 95%), the risk of recurrence is not actually 
increased. Currently available evidence suggests that recurrence 
is chromosome-specific and, therefore, in the majority of cases, 
the likely mechanism is parental mosaicism. 
Recurrence of chromosomal defects 
• If a woman has had a previous fetus or baby with a trisomy, 
the risk in the current pregnancy is 0.75% higher than her a 
priori risk. 
• Recurrence is chromosome-specific. 
Fetal nuchal translucency 
Fetal NT normally increases with gestation (crown–rump 
length). In a fetus with a given crown–rump length, every NT 
measurement represents a likelihood ratio which is multiplied by 
the a priori maternal and gestational age-related risk to calculate 
a new risk. The larger the NT, the higher the likelihood ratio 
becomes and therefore the higher the new risk. In contrast, the 
smaller the NT measurement, the smaller the likelihood ratio 
becomes and therefore the lower the new risk (Figure 6).

flow velocity waveform from the ductus venosus are observed 
in about 80% of fetuses with trisomy 21 and in 5% of 
chromosomally normal fetuses. 
Similarly, the prevalence of other sonographic markers, such as 
exomphalos, megacystis and single umbilical artery, are higher 
in certain chromosomal abnormalities than in chromosomally 
normal fetuses. Each of these sonographic markers is associated 
with a likelihood ratio, which can be multiplied by the a priori 
risk to calculate a new risk. 
Maternal serum biochemistry in the first-trimester 
The level of free b-hCG in maternal blood normally decreases 
with gestation. In trisomy 21 pregnancies free b-hCG is

increased. The level of PAPP-A in maternal blood normally 
increases with gestation and in trisomy 21 pregnancies the level is 
decreased. For a given gestation, each b-hCG and PAPP-A level 
represents a likelihood ratio that is multiplied by the a priori risk 
to calculate the new risk. The higher the level of b-hCG and the 
lower the level of PAPP-A the higher the risk for trisomy 21 
(Figure 7). 
NUCHAL TRANSLUCENCY THICKNESS 
Cystic hygromas, nuchal edema and nuchal translucency 
During the second and third trimesters of pregnancy, abnormal 
accumulation of fluid behind the fetal neck can be classified as 
nuchal cystic hygroma or nuchal edema. In about 75% of fetuses 
with cystic hygromas, there is a chromosomal abnormality and, in 
about 95% of cases, the abnormality is Turner syndrome. Nuchal 
edema has a diverse etiology; chromosomal abnormalities are 
found in about one-third of the fetuses and, in about 75% of

cases, the abnormality is trisomy 21 or 18. Edema is also associated 
with fetal cardiovascular and pulmonary defects, skeletal 
dysplasias, congenital infections and metabolic and hematological 
disorders; consequently, the prognosis for chromosomally normal 
fetuses with nuchal edema is poor. 
In the first trimester, the term translucency is used, irrespective 
of whether it is septated or not and whether it is confined to the 
neck or envelopes the whole fetus. During the second trimester, 
the translucency usually resolves and, in a few cases, it evolves 
into either nuchal edema or cystic hygromas with or without 
generalized hydrops. Neither the incidence of chromosomal 
defects nor the prognosis can be predicted by the ultrasonographic 
appearance of the lesion. 
Increased NT is associated with trisomy 21, Turner syndrome and 
other chromosomal defects as well as many fetal malformations 
and genetic syndromes. The incidence of these abnormalities 
is related to the thickness, rather than the appearance, of NT. 
Furthermore, it is possible to standardize and audit the results of 
a measurement but not those of a subjective appearance. 
Nuchal translucency – definition 
•Nuchal translucency is the sonographic appearance of subcutaneous 
accumulation of fluid behind the fetal neck in the 
first trimester of pregnancy. 
•The term translucency is used, irrespective of whether it is 
septated or not and whether it is confined to the neck or 
envelopes the whole fetus. 
•The incidence of chromosomal and other abnormalities is 
related to the size, rather than the appearance of NT. 
•During the second trimester, the translucency usually resolves 
and, in a few cases, it evolves into either nuchal edema or 
cystic hygromas with or without generalized hydrops. 
The 11–13+6 weeks scan 

Measurement of nuchal translucency 
The ability to achieve a reliable measurement of NT is dependent 
on appropriate training and adherence to a standard technique in 
order to achieve uniformity of results among different operators. 
Gestation and crown-rump length 
The optimal gestational age for measurement of fetal NT is 11 
weeks to 13 weeks and 6 days. The minimum fetal crown–rump 
length should be 45 mm and the maximum 84 mm. 
There are two reasons for selecting 11 weeks as the earliest 
gestation for measurements of NT. Firstly, screening necessitates 
the availability of a diagnostic test and chorionic villous sampling 
before this gestation is associated with transverse limb reduction 
defects. Secondly, many major fetal defects can be diagnosed at 
the NT scan, provided the minimum gestation is 11 weeks. For 
example, diagnosis or exclusion of acrania and therefore anencephaly, 
cannot be made before 11 weeks because sonographic 
assessment of ossification of the fetal skull is not reliable before 
this gestation. Examination of the four-chamber view of the heart 
and main arteries is possible only after 10 weeks. At 8–10 weeks 
all fetuses demonstrate herniation of the midgut that is visualized 
as a hyperechogenic mass in the base of the umbilical cord, and 
it is therefore unsafe to diagnose or exclude exomphalos at this 
gestation. The fetal bladder can be visualized in only 50% of 
fetuses at 10 weeks, in 80% at 11 weeks and in all cases by 
12 weeks. 
The reasons for selecting 13 weeks and 6 days as the upper limit 
are firstly, to provide women with affected fetuses the option 
Chapter 1 • First trimester diagnosis of chromosomal defects 

of first rather than second trimester termination, secondly, the 
incidence of abnormal accumulation of nuchal fluid in chromosomally 
abnormal fetuses is lower at 14–18 weeks than before 
14 weeks, and thirdly, the success rate for taking a measurement 
at 10–13 weeks is 98–100%, falling to 90% at 14 weeks because 
the fetus becomes vertical making it more difficult to obtain the 
appropriate image. 
Image and measurement 
In the assessment of fetal NT the ultrasound machine should be 
of high resolution with a video-loop function and callipers that 
provide measurements to one decimal point. Fetal NT can be 
measured successfully by transabdominal ultrasound examination 
in about 95% of cases; in the others, it is necessary to perform 
transvaginal sonography. The results from transabdominal and 
transvaginal scanning are similar. 
Only the fetal head and upper thorax should be included in the 
image for measurement of NT (Figure 8a). The magnification 
should be as large as possible and always such that each slight 
movement of the callipers produces only a 0.1 mm change in the 
measurement. In magnifying the image, either pre or post freeze 
zoom, it is important to turn the gain down. This avoids the 
mistake of placing the calliper on the fuzzy edge of the line which 
causes an underestimate of the nuchal measurement. 
A good sagittal section of the fetus, as for measurement of fetal 
crown–rump length, should be obtained and the NT should be 
measured with the fetus in the neutral position. When the fetal 
neck is hyperextended the measurement can be increased by 
0.6 mm and when the neck is flexed, the measurement can be 
decreased by 0.4 mm. 
The 11–13+6 weeks scan

Figure 8. Ultrasound pictures of 12-weeks fetus. In all six images there is a good sagittal section of the 
fetus. Image (a) is appropriate for measurement of the nuchal translucency (NT) because only the fetal 
head and upper thorax are included and the nuchal membrane, which is thin, can be seen separate from 
the amniotic membrane. In (b) the magnification is too small for accurate measurement of NT. In (c) the 
fetal neck is hyperextended and in (d) the neck is too flexed. In (e) the maximum measurement of NT 
should be taken. In (f) the umbilical cord is round the neck. In this case the NT should be measured both 
above and below the cord and the average of the two measurements should be used in the calculation 
of risk. 
Care must be taken to distinguish between fetal skin and amnion 
because, at this gestation, both structures appear as thin membranes 
(Figure 8a). This is achieved by waiting for spontaneous 
Chapter 1 • First trimester diagnosis of chromosomal defects 

fetal movement away from the amniotic membrane; alternatively, 
the fetus is bounced off the amnion by asking the mother to 
cough and/or by tapping the maternal abdomen. 
The maximum thickness of the subcutaneous translucency 
between the skin and the soft tissue overlying the cervical spine 
should be measured (Figure 8e). The callipers should be placed 
on the lines that define the NT thickness – the crossbar of the 
calliper should be such that it is hardly visible as it merges with 
the white line of the border and not in the nuchal fluid. During 
the scan, more than one measurement must be taken and the 
maximum one should be recorded. 
The umbilical cord may be round the fetal neck in 5–10% of 
cases and this finding may produce a falsely increased NT. In 
such cases, the measurements of NT above and below the cord 
are different and, in the calculation of risk, it is more appropriate 
to use the average of the two measurements (Figure 8f ). 
There are no clinically relevant effects on NT measurements 
by ethnic origin, parity or gravidity, cigarette smoking, diabetic 
control, conception by assisted reproduction techniques, bleeding 
in early pregnancy or fetal gender. 
The intra-observer and inter-observer differences in measurements 
of fetal NT are less than 0.5 mm in 95% of cases. 
Deviation in measurement from normal 
Fetal NT increases with crown–rump length and therefore it 
is essential to take gestation into account when determining 
whether a given NT thickness is increased. In a study involving 
96,127 pregnancies, the median and 95th centile at a 
The 11–13+6 weeks scan 

crown-rump-length of 45 mm were 1.2 and 2.1 mm and the 
respective values at crown rump length of 84 mm were 1.9 and 
2.7 mm (Snijders et al 1998). 
In screening for chromosomal defects patient-specific risks are 
derived by multiplying the a priori maternal age and gestation-
related risk by a likelihood ratio, which depends on the difference 
(Delta value in mm) in fetal NT measurement from the normal 
median for the same crown-rump length (Figures 9–11). 
In screening using maternal serum biochemical markers a different 
approach has been used to take into account the gestational 
age related change in marker levels. This method involves 
converting the measured concentration into a multiple of the 
median (MoM) of unaffected pregnancies of the same gestation. 
Essentially, the Gaussian distributions of log10 (NT MoM) in 
trisomy 21 and unaffected pregnancies are derived and the 
heights of the distributions at a particular MoM, which is the 
likelihood ratio for trisomy 21, is used to modify the a priori 
maternal age-related risk to derive the patient-specific risk.

In screening by NT the Delta approach provides accurate 
patient-specific risks (Spencer et al 2003). In contrast, the MoM 
approach was found to be inappropriate for this purpose, because 
none of the three basic assumptions that underpin this method 
are valid. Firstly, in the unaffected population the distributions 
of NT MoM and log10(NT MoM) are not Gaussian, secondly, 
The 11–13+6 weeks scan 

the SD’s do not remain constant with gestation and thirdly, the 
median MoM in the trisomy 21 pregnancies is not a constant 
proportion of the median for unaffected pregnancies. The MoM 
approach results in women being given an overestimate of risk 
for trisomy at 11 weeks and a considerable underestimate of risk 
at 13 weeks. 
Nuchal translucency – measurement 
•The gestation should be 11–13+6 weeks and the fetal crown– 
rump length should be 45–84 mm. 
•A mid-sagittal section of the fetus should be obtained and the 
NT should be measured with the fetus in the neutral position. 
•Only the fetal head and upper thorax should be included in 
the image. The magnification should be as large as possible 
and always such that each slight movement of the callipers

produces only a 0.1 mm change in the measurement. 
Training and quality assessment in the measurement of NT 
Appropriate training of sonographers and adherence to a 
standard technique for the measurement of NT are essential 
prerequisites for good clinical practice. Furthermore, the success 
of a screening program necessitates the presence of a system for 
Chapter 1 • First trimester diagnosis of chromosomal defects 

regular audit of results and continuous assessment of the quality 
of images. 
All sonographers performing fetal scans should be capable of 
reliably measuring the crown–rump length and obtaining a 
proper sagittal view of the fetal spine. For such sonographers, 
it is easy to acquire, within a few hours, the skill to measure 
NT thickness. However, the ability to measure NT and obtain 
reproducible results improves with training. Good results are 
achieved after 80 scans for the transabdominal route and 100 
scans transvaginally. 
Several studies have demonstrated that ongoing regular audit of 
images and the distribution of measurements of NT is essential 
for assessing the quality of a centre and is also useful in identifying 
individual sonographers whose results deviate from the mean 
performance. The inter-examination variation in measurements 
is reduced considerably after an initial learning phase and after 
feedback to the sonographers on the distribution of their 
measurements and the quality of their images. 
The Fetal Medicine Foundation (FMF), which is a UK 
registered charity, has established a process of training and 
quality assurance for the appropriate introduction of NT screening 
into clinical practice. Training is based on a theoretical 
course, practical instruction on how to obtain the appropriate 
image and make the correct measurement of NT, and presentation 
of a logbook of images. These are examined to determine 
if the magnification is adequate, the section of the fetus is truly 
sagittal and the head is in the neutral position, the amnion is seen 
separately from the nuchal membrane and the callipers are placed 
appropriately. Ongoing quality assurance is based on assessment 
of the distribution of fetal NT measurements (Figure 12) and 
examination of a sample of images obtained by each sonographer 
involved in screening.

Nuchal translucency thickness and risk for chromosomal defects 
In 1992 a study, in which fetal NT was measured before CVS for 
fetal karyotyping, reported that in a high proportion of chromosomally 
abnormal fetuses the NT thickness was increased 
(Nicolaides et al 1992). 
This association was subsequently confirmed in several other 
studies in the early 1990s. Thus, in the combined data from 17 
series involving a total of 1,690 patients with increased fetal NT 
the incidence of chromosomal defects was 29% (Nicolaides 
2004). However, there were large differences between the studies 
in the incidence of chromosomal defects, ranging from 11% to 
88%, because of differences in the maternal age distributions of 
the populations examined and the definition of the minimum 
abnormal NT thickness, which ranged from 2 mm to 10 mm. 
Studies in the mid 1990’s demonstrated that firstly, in normal 
pregnancies, fetal NT thickness increases with gestation, 
The 11–13+6 weeks scan 

secondly, in trisomy 21 and other major chromosomal defects 
fetal NT is increased, and thirdly, the risk for trisomies can be 
derived by multiplying the a priori maternal age and gestation-
related risk by a likelihood ratio, which depends on the degree of 
deviation in fetal NT measurement from the normal median for 
that crown–rump length (Nicolaides et al 1994, Pandya et al 
1995). 
It was estimated that, in a pregnant population with a mean 
maternal age of 28 years, using the risk cut-off of 1 in 300 to 
define the screen positive group would detect about 80% of 
trisomy 21 fetuses for a false positive rate of 5%. 
Nuchal translucency – calculation of patient-specific risk 
• The risk for trisomies is derived by multiplying the a priori 
maternal age and gestation-related risk by the NT likelihood 
ratio. 
• The NT likelihood ratio depends on the degree of deviation 
in fetal NT measurement from the normal median for that 
crown–rump length. 
Implementation of nuchal translucency screening in routine practice 
Several prospective interventional studies have examined the 
implementation of NT screening in routine practice (Nicolaides 
2004). 
In some of the studies the screen positive group was defined by a 
cut-off in fetal NT or a combined risk derived from the maternal 
age and deviation in fetal NT from the normal median for fetal 
crown-rump length. 
The important findings of these studies are, firstly, fetal NT was 
successfully measured in more than 99% of cases, secondly, there 
were inevitable variations in false positive and detection rates 
between the studies because of differences in the maternal age 
Chapter 1 • First trimester diagnosis of chromosomal defects 

distribution of their populations and in fetal NT or risk cut-offs 
used, and thirdly, in the combined data on more than 200,000 
pregnancies, including more than 900 fetuses with trisomy 21, 
fetal NT screening identified more than 75% of fetuses with 
trisomy 21 and other major chromosomal defects for a false positive 
rate of 5%, or the detection rate was about 60% for a false 
positive rate of 1% (Nicolaides 2004). 
In the largest study, coordinated by the FMF, 100,311 singleton 
pregnancies were examined by 306 appropriately trained 
sonographers in 22 UK centers (Snijders et al 1998). In all cases 
the fetal NT and crown–rump length were measured and individual 
patient-specific risks, based on maternal age, gestational 
age and fetal NT were calculated. Follow-up was obtained from 
96,127 cases, including 326 with trisomy 21 and 325 with other 
chromosomal defects (Table 3). The median gestation at the time

The 11–13+6 weeks scan 

of screening was 12 weeks and the median maternal age was 
31 years. 
The estimated risk for trisomy 21 was 1 in 300 or more in 8% of 
the normal pregnancies, in 82% of those with trisomy 21 and 
in 78% with other chromosomal defects. For a screen-positive 
rate of 5%, the detection rate was 77% (95% confidence interval 
72–82%). 
The issue of spontaneous fetal death 
Screening for chromosomal defects in the first, rather than the 
second trimester, has the advantage of earlier prenatal diagnosis 
and consequently less traumatic termination of pregnancy for 
those couples who choose this option. A potential disadvantage 
is that earlier screening preferentially identifies those chromosomally 
abnormal pregnancies that are destined to miscarry. 
Approximately 30% of affected fetuses die between 12 weeks of 
gestation and term. This issue of preferential spontaneous death 
in fetuses with chromosomal defects is, of course, a potential 
criticism of all methods of antenatal screening, including second-
trimester maternal serum biochemistry, because the rate of fetal 
death between 16 weeks and term is about 20%. 
In prenatal screening studies it is impossible to know how many 
of the trisomy 21 pregnancies that were terminated would have 
resulted in live births. However, it is possible to estimate the 
impact of prenatal screening on the prevalence of trisomy 21 in 
live births. This can be done by comparing the number of 
affected live births with the number estimated on the basis of the 
maternal age-related prevalence of trisomy 21 in live births and 
the maternal age distribution of the population screened. In the 
FMF screening study, by a combination of maternal age and 
fetal NT, a risk cut-off of 1 in 300 was associated with a false 
positive rate of 8% and a detection rate of 82% (Snijders et al 
Chapter 1 • First trimester diagnosis of chromosomal defects 

1998). It was estimated that prenatal screening followed by 
invasive diagnostic testing and selective termination of affected 
fetuses would have reduced the potential live birth prevalence of 
trisomy 21 by 78–82%. 
Nuchal translucency – effectiveness of screening for trisomy 21 
•Prospective studies in more than 200,000 pregnancies, 
including more than 900 fetuses with trisomy 21, have 
demonstrated that NT screening can identify more than 75% 
of fetuses with trisomy 21 for a false positive rate of 5%. 
•Increased NT does not necessarily identify those trisomic 
fetuses that are destined to die in utero. 
•The observed detection rate of trisomy 21 with first trimester 
NT screening is only 2–3% higher than the detection rate of 
affected pregnancies that would potentially result in livebirths. 
Observational studies 
The ability to achieve a reliable measurement of NT is dependent 
on appropriate training, adherence to a standard technique and 
motivation of the sonographer. All three components are well 
illustrated by the differences in results between interventional 
and observational studies, in which the sonographers were asked 
to record the fetal NT measurements but not act on the results 
(Nicolaides 2004). Thus, successful measurement of NT was 
achieved in more than 99% of cases in the interventional studies, 
but in only 75% of cases in the observational studies. Furthermore 
in the interventional studies there was increased NT in 
76.8% of the trisomy 21 and 4.2% of the chromosomally normal 
fetuses, compared to the respective rates of 38.4% and 5.0% in 
the observational studies. 
In the observational studies, the scans were often carried out at 
inappropriate gestations and the sonographers were either not 
trained adequately or they were not sufficiently motivated to 
The 11–13+6 weeks scan 

measure NT. For example, in one of the studies, in which 
sonographers were instructed to take no extra scanning time 
other than that necessary for measurement of the crown-rump 
length, fetal NT was successfully measured in only 66% of cases 
(Roberts et al 1995). In another study, the fetal crown-rump 
length was less than 33 mm in 54% of cases and the 
sonographers, who were instructed to measure fetal NT within 
three minutes, were unable to do so in 42% of cases (Kornman 
et al 1996). These methodological problems are further highlighted 
by a study of 47,053 singleton pregnancies examined at 
6–16 weeks (Wald et al 2003a). In 23% of the patients no valid 
NT measurement was taken because the scans were carried out 
at inappropriate gestations or the sonographers were unable to 
obtain a measurement or none of the images were deemed to be 
of an acceptable quality. 
Further evidence on the difference between observational and 
interventional studies is provided by Crossley et al (2002). In this 
observational study, 17,229 pregnancies were recruited and fetal 
NT was successfully measured in 73% of cases. In a subsequent 
study of more than 2,000 pregnancies in which the results of 
the scan were given to the women, fetal NT was successfully 
measured in 99.8% of cases. 
Nuchal translucency and maternal serum biochemistry 
Trisomic pregnancies are associated with altered maternal serum 
concentrations of various feto-placental products, including AFP, 
free b-hCG, uE3, inhibin A and PAPP-A. Screening in the 
second trimester by maternal age and various combinations of 
free b-hCG, AFP, uE3 and Inhibin A can identify 50–75% of 
trisomy 21 pregnancies for a false positive rate of 5%. Screening 
in the first trimester by a combination of maternal age and serum 
free b-hCG and PAPP-A identifies about 60% of affected 
pregnancies for a false positive rate of 5%. However, an essential 
Chapter 1 • First trimester diagnosis of chromosomal defects 

component of biochemical screening is accurate dating of the 
pregnancy by ultrasound, otherwise the detection rate is reduced 
by about 10%. 
Fetal NT and maternal serum testing in the first-trimester 
In trisomy 21 pregnancies at 12 weeks, the maternal serum 
concentration of free b-hCG (about 2 MoM) is higher than in 
chromosomally normal fetuses whereas PAPP-A is lower (about 
0.5 MoM). The difference in maternal serum free b-hCG 
between normal and trisomy 21 pregnancies increases with 
advancing gestation and the difference in PAPP-A decreases 
with gestation. These temporal variations in marker levels, their 
interrelation and their association with maternal weight should be 
taken into account when developing risk algorithms in order to 
produce accurate patient-specific risks. 
There is no significant association between fetal NT and 
maternal serum free b-hCG or PAPP-A in either trisomy 21 or 
chromosomally normal pregnancies and therefore the ultrasononographic 
and biochemical markers can be combined to 
provide more effective screening than either method individually 
(Spencer et al 1999). Six prospective screening studies have 
confirmed the feasibility and effectiveness of combining fetal NT 
and maternal serum free b-hCG and PAPP-A. In the combined 
data on a total of 38,804 pregnancies, including 182 with trisomy 
21, the detection rate for trisomy 21 at a 5% false positive rate 
was 86% (Nicolaides 2004). 
In trisomies 18 and 13 maternal serum free b-hCG and 
PAPP-A are decreased. In cases of sex chromosomal anomalies 
maternal serum free b-hCG is normal and PAPP-A is low. In 
paternally derived triploidy maternal serum free b-hCG is greatly 
increased, whereas PAPP-A is mildly decreased. Maternally 
derived triploidy is associated with markedly decreased maternal 
The 11–13+6 weeks scan 

serum free b-hCG and PAPP-A. Screening by a combination of 
fetal NT and maternal serum PAPP-A and free b-hCG can 
identify about 90% of all these chromosomal abnormalities for a 
screen positive rate of 1%, in addition to the 5% necessary in 
screening for trisomy 21. 
An important development in biochemical analysis is the introduction 
of a new technique (random access immunoassay analyzer 
using time-resolved-amplified-cryptate-emission), which 
provides automated, precise and reproducible measurements 
within 30 minutes of obtaining a blood sample. This has made it 
possible to combine biochemical and ultrasonographic testing as 
well as to counsel in one-stop clinics for early assessment of fetal 
risk (OSCAR) (Bindra et al 2002, Spencer et al 2003b). 
Fetal NT and maternal serum testing in the second-trimester 
In women having second-trimester biochemical testing following 
first-trimester NT screening the a priori risk needs to be adjusted 
to take into account the first-trimester screening results. 
Prospective studies of screening by a combination of fetal NT in 
the first trimester and maternal serum biochemistry in the second 
trimester reported that for a false positive rate of 5% the detection 
rate of trisomy 21 (85–90%) is similar to combined screening in 
the first trimester (Nicolaides 2004). 
Integration of first and second trimester testing 
A statistical model combining first-trimester fetal NT and 
maternal serum PAPP-A with second-trimester free b-hCG, uE3 
and inhibin A, estimated that for a false positive rate of 5% the 
detection rate of trisomy 21 could be 94% (Wald et al 1999). 
This test assumes complete compliance by the pregnant women 
in firstly, participating in a two stage process separated by one 
month, secondly, in having an ultrasound scan without receiving 
Chapter 1 • First trimester diagnosis of chromosomal defects 

information as to whether the fetus looks normal or not, and 
thirdly, accepting second rather than first trimester diagnosis and 
termination. It is therefore likely that even if the estimates of this 
hypothetical test are found to be true in prospective studies, it 
will not gain widespread clinical acceptability. 
Some of the logistical problems in the implementation of an 
integrated test are highlighted by the results of a multicentre 
observational study (SURUSS) investigating first and second 
trimester screening for trisomy 21 (Wald et al 2003a). The aim 
was to obtain a measurement of fetal NT in the first trimester and 
collect maternal serum and urine samples in the first and second 
trimesters. Intervention was based on the second trimester serum 
results and all other data were analyzed retrospectively. However, 
of the 47,053 women that were recruited, only 60% completed all 
components of the protocol. In this study there were 101 fetuses 
with trisomy 21 and satisfactory NT images were obtained only 
from 75 of the cases. The data were used to derive a statistical 
model suggesting that for a 5% false positive rate, 93% of trisomy 
21 fetuses could be detected by the integrated test. However, it is 
likely that this model is inaccurate. For example, the predicted 
detection rates, for a 5% false positive rate, were 71% for the 
double test, 77% for the triple test and 83% for the quadruple 
test, which are substantially higher than the respective rates 
of 61%, 66% and 75% reported by the same authors in their 
prospective screening studies (Wald et al 2003b). 
A similar study in the USA (FASTER trial), reported its 
findings in the subgroup of 33,557 pregnancies with complete 
first and second trimester data, including 84 cases of trisomy 21 
(Malone et al 2004). It was estimated that, for a 5.4% false 
positive rate, 90% of trisomy 21 fetuses could be detected. 
Prospective studies have demonstrated that such results are 
achievable by screening with fetal NT and maternal serum 
The 11–13+6 weeks scan 

free b-hCG and PAPP-A in the first-trimester (Bindra et al 
2002, Spencer et al 2003b). It is therefore essential that, in 
screening, attention is paid to the provision of high quality sonographic 
and biochemical services for early diagnosis of chromosomal 
defects, rather than the development of theoretical models 
which would delay diagnosis until the second trimester and are, 
in any case, unlikely to be implemented in clinical practice. 
Screening by nuchal translucency and serum biochemistry 
•In trisomy 21 pregnancies at 11–13+6 weeks, the maternal 
serum concentration of free b-hCG is higher (about 2 MoM) 
and PAPP-A is lower (about 0.5 MoM) than in chromosomally 
normal fetuses. 
•There is no significant association between fetal NT and 
maternal serum free b-hCG or PAPP-A in either trisomy 21 or 
chromosomally normal pregnancies. The ultrasononographic 
and biochemical markers can be combined to provide more 
effective screening than either method individually. 
•Prospective studies, in more than 50,000 pregnancies, including 
more than 250 fetuses with trisomy 21, have demonstrated 
that screening by a combination of fetal NT and either 
first or second trimester maternal serum biochemistry can 
identify 85–90% of fetuses with trisomy 21 for a false positive 
rate of 5%. 
•In trisomies 18 and 13 maternal serum free b-hCG and 
PAPP-A are decreased. In sex chromosomal anomalies maternal 
serum free b-hCG is normal and PAPP-A is low. In paternally 
derived triploidy maternal serum free b-hCG is greatly 
increased, whereas PAPP-A is mildly decreased. Maternally 
derived triploidy is associated with markedly decreased 
maternal serum free b-hCG and PAPP-A. Screening by a 
combination of fetal NT and maternal serum PAPP-A and 
free b-hCG can identify about 90% of all these chromosomal 
abnormalities for a screen positive rate of 1%, in addition to 
the 5% in screening for trisomy 21. 
Chapter 1 • First trimester diagnosis of chromosomal defects 

WOMENS’ ATTITUDES TO 1ST VERSUS 2ND TRIMESTER SCREENING 
Studies investigating the preference of pregnant women in terms 
of the methods of screening, have reported that the vast majority 
prefer this to be carried out in the first rather than in the second 
trimester. A criticism of NT screening has been that some 
women with increased fetal NT will face unnecessary decisions 
regarding invasive testing and ultimately pregnancy termination 
in an affected pregnancy that would otherwise have ended in 
spontaneous miscarriage. In a survey of women’s preferences, 
about 70% stated that they would still choose NT screening even 
if all the Down’s syndrome pregnancies identified by this method 
miscarried before the second trimester (Mulvey and Wallace 
2000). The women wanted to know if their fetus had had Down’s 
syndrome regardless of the pregnancy outcome and they also 
valued the knowledge of an underlying reason for a miscarriage 
if it occurred. 
Clinical importance of respect for autonomy 
Respect for autonomy is a central principle in medical ethics and 
law. This ethical principle obliges the physician to elicit and 
implement the patient’s preferences. The relevance of respect for 
autonomy to first trimester screening is two-fold. Firstly, early 
diagnosis of fetal abnormality and the option of early termination 
of pregnancy are important to many women. Secondly, most first 
trimester screening tests provide reassurance for many women 
who would prefer not to have an invasive procedure if the 
risk is low. Consequently, the provision of a high-quality first 
trimester screening service significantly enhances the autonomy 
of pregnant women (Chasen et al 2001). 
The vast majority of pregnant women prefer screening and 
diagnosis to be performed in the first, rather than in the second 
trimester.

SONOGRAPHIC FEATURES OF CHROMOSOMAL DEFECTS 
Each chromosomal defect has its own syndromal pattern of 
detectable abnormalities. This chapter describes the sonographic 
features of trisomy 21 and other major chromosomal defects in 
the first and second trimesters of pregnancy. 
FIRST TRIMESTER ULTRASONOGRAPHY 
At 11–13+6 weeks, all major chromosomal defects are associated 
with increased NT thickness (Snijders et al 1998). In trisomies 
21, 18 and 13 the pattern of increase in NT is similar and the 
average NT in these defects is about 2.5 mm above the normal 
median for crown-rump length. In Turner syndrome, the median 
NT is about 8 mm above the normal median. 
In addition to increased NT, in trisomy 21, 60–70% of fetuses 
have absent nasal bone, 25% have a short maxilla, and 80% 
have abnormal Doppler waveforms in the ductus venosus. In 
trisomy 18, there is early onset fetal growth restriction, a tendency 
for bradycardia and exomphalos in 30% of cases, absent 
nasal bone in 55% and single umbilical artery in 75%. In trisomy 
13, there is tachycardia in about 70% of the cases and early 
onset fetal growth restriction, megacystis, holoprosencephaly or 
exomphalos in about 40% of the cases. In Turner syndrome, 
there is tachycardia in about 50% of cases and early onset fetal 
growth restriction. In triploidy, there is early onset asymmetrical 
Chapter 2 • Sonographic features of chromosomal defects 

fetal growth restriction, bradycardia in 30% of cases, holoprosencephaly, 
exomphalos or posterior fossa cyst in about 40% and 
molar changes in the placenta in about 30%. 
Absence of fetal nasal bone 
In 1866 Langdon Down noted that a common characteristic of 
patients with trisomy 21 is a small nose. Anthropometric studies 
in patients with Down’s syndrome have reported that the 
nasal root depth is abnormally short in 50% of cases (Farkas et al 
2001). Similarly, post mortem radiological studies in aborted 
fetuses with trisomy 21 have reported absence of ossification or 
hypoplasia of the nasal bone in about 50% of cases. Sonographic 
studies at 15–24 weeks of gestation reported that about 65% of 
trisomy 21 fetuses have absent or short nasal bone. 
The fetal nasal bone can be visualized by sonography at 11–13+6 
weeks of gestation (Cicero et al 2001). Several studies have demonstrated 
a high association between absent nasal bone at 11–13+6 
weeks and trisomy 21, as well as other chromosomal abnormalities 
(Nicolaides 2004). In the combined data from these studies on a 
total of 15,822 fetuses the fetal profile was successfully examined 
in 97.4% cases and the nasal bone was absent in 1.4% of the chromosomally 
normal fetuses and in 69% of fetuses with trisomy 21. 
An important finding of these studies was that the incidence 
of absent nasal bone decreased with fetal crown-rump length, 
increased with NT thickness and was substantially higher in 
Afro-Caribbeans than in Caucasians. Consequently, in the calculation 
of likelihood ratios in screening for trisomy 21 adjustments 
must be made for these confounding factors (Cicero et al 2004). 
Integrated first-trimester sonographic and biochemical screening 
A case-control study comprising of 100 trisomy 21 and 400 
chromosomally normal singleton pregnancies at 11–13+6 weeks 
The 11–13+6 weeks scan 

of gestation examined the potential performance of screening for 
trisomy 21 by a combination of sonography for measurement of 
fetal NT and assessment of the presence or absence of the fetal 
nasal bone and measurement of maternal serum free b-hCG and 
PAPP-A (Cicero et al 2003). It was estimated that for a false 
positive rate of 5%, the detection rate of trisomy 21 would be 97%. 
Examination of the nasal bone 
•The gestation should be 11–13+6 weeks and the fetal 
crown–rump length should be 45–84 mm. 
•The image should be magnified so that the head and the 
upper thorax only are included in the screen. 
•A mid-sagittal view of the fetal profile should be obtained 
with the ultrasound transducer held in parallel to the direction 
of the nose. 
•In the image of the nose there should be three distinct lines. 
The top line represents the skin and the bottom one, which is 
thicker and more echogenic than the overlying skin, represents 
the nasal bone. A third line, almost in continuity with the 
skin, but at a higher level, represents the tip of the nose. 
•At 11–13+6 weeks the fetal profile can be successfully 
examined in more than 95% of cases. 
•In chromosomally normal fetuses the incidence of absent 
nasal bone is less than 1% in Caucasian populations and 
about 10% in Afro-Caribbeans. 
•The nasal bone is absent in 60–70% of trisomy 21 fetuses, 
in about 50% of trisomy 18 fetuses and 30% of trisomy 13 
fetuses. 
•For a false positive rate of 5%, screening by a combination of 
sonography for fetal NT and nasal bone and maternal serum 
free b-hCG and PAPP-A can potentially identify more than 
95% of trisomy 21 pregnancies. 
•It is imperative that sonographers undertaking risk assessment 
by examination of the fetal profile receive appropriate 
training and certification of their competence in performing 
such a scan. 
Chapter 2 • Sonographic features of chromosomal defects 

Crown–rump length 
Trisomy 18 and triploidy are associated with moderately severe 
growth restriction, trisomy 13 and Turner syndrome with mild 
growth restriction, whereas in trisomy 21 growth is essentially 
normal (Figure 1; Nicolaides et al 1996).

Figure 1. Fetal crown-rump length in fetuses with triploidy plotted on the reference range (mean, 95th 
and 5th centiles) with gestation of chromosomally normal fetuses. 
The 11–13+6 weeks scan 

Maxillary length 
Langdon Down observed that in individuals with trisomy 21 
‘the face is flat’. This may be the consequence of underdevelopment 
of the maxilla. Anthropometric and radiological 
studies in patients with Down’s syndrome have demonstrated 
underdevelopment of the maxilla in more than 50% of cases 
(Farkas et al 2001). 
The fetal maxilla can be easily visualized and measured by 
sonography at 11–13+6 weeks of gestation (Cicero et al 2004). 
A mid-sagittal view of the fetal profile is first obtained and 
the transducer is then gently angled laterally so that both the 
maxillary bone and mandible, including the ramus and condylar 
process, can be seen (Figure 2). In chromosomally normal 
fetuses maxillary length increases linearly with gestation by about 
0.1 mm for each 1 mm increase in crown-rump length. In the 
trisomy 21 fetuses the median maxillary length is significantly 
below the normal median for crown-rump length by 0.7 mm. 
Figure 2. Ultrasound picture of a 12-weeks fetus demonstrating measurement of maxillary length. 
Chapter 2 • Sonographic features of chromosomal defects 

However, there is a significant association between maxillary 
bone length and NT thickness and in fetuses with absent 
nasal bone the maxilla is shorter than in those with present nasal 
bone. Consequently, the independent contribution of maxillary 
length in screening for trisomy 21 remains to be determined. In 
fetuses with other chromosomal defects there are no significant 
differences from normal in the maxillary length. 
Ear length 
In postnatal life, short ears constitute the most consistent clinical 
characteristic of patients with Down’s syndrome. The fetal ears 
can be easily visualized and measured by sonography at 11–13+6 
weeks of gestation (Sacchini et al 2003). Although in trisomy 
21 fetuses the median ear length is significantly below the 
normal median for crown-rump length, the degree of deviation 
from normal is too small for this measurement to be useful in 
screening for trisomy 21. 
Femur and humerus length 
Trisomy 21 is characterised by short stature and during the 
second trimester the condition is associated with relative shortening 
of the femur and more so the humerus. At 11–13+6 
weeks in trisomy 21 fetuses the median femur and humerus 
lengths are significantly below the appropriate normal median 
for crown-rump length but the degree of deviation from normal 
is too small for these measurements to be useful in screening 
(Longo et al 2004). 
Single umbilical artery 
A single umbilical artery, found in about 1% of deliveries, is 
associated with malformations of all major organ systems and 
The 11–13+6 weeks scan 

chromosomal defects. In the first-trimester the umbilical arteries 
can be visualized by color flow mapping on either side of the 
bladder and in continuity with the umbilical cord insertion to the 
fetus in an oblique transverse section of the lower fetal abdomen. 
At 11–13+6 weeks single umbilical artery is found in about 3% 
of chromosomally normal fetuses and in 80% of fetuses with 
trisomy 18 (Rembouskos et al 2003). In the fetuses with single 
umbilical artery the observed number of cases of trisomy 21 
is not significantly different from the number estimated on the 
basis of maternal age and fetal NT. In contrast, a single umbilical 
artery is associated with a seven fold increase in risk of trisomy 
18. However, a high proportion of trisomy 18 fetuses have other 
major defects that are easily detectable at the 11–13+6 weeks scan 
and many other abnormalities that are detectable at 16–20 weeks. 
It is therefore unlikely that the finding of a single umbilical artery 
per se should be an indication for fetal karyotyping. 
Megacystis 
The fetal bladder can be visualized by sonography in about 80% 
of fetuses at 11 weeks of gestation and in all cases by 13 weeks. 
At this gestation the fetal bladder length is normally less than 
6 mm. Fetal megacystis in the first-trimester, defined by a longitudinal 
bladder diameter of 7 mm or more, is found in about 1 in 
1,500 pregnancies (Figure 3). When the longitudinal bladder 
diameter is 7–15 mm the incidence of chromosomal defects, 
mainly trisomies 13 and 18, is about 20%, but in the chromosomally 
normal group there is spontaneous resolution of the 
megacystis in about 90% of cases (Liao et al 2003). In contrast, 
in megacystis with bladder diameter greater than 15 mm the 
incidence of chromosomal defects is about 10% and in the chromosomally 
normal group the condition is invariably associated 
Chapter 2 • Sonographic features of chromosomal defects 

Figure 3. Ultrasound picture of a 12-weeks fetus with megacystis. 
with progressive obstructive uropathy. Megacystis is associated 
with increased NT, which is observed in about 75% of those with 
chromosomal defects and in about 30% of those with normal 
karyotype. After taking into account maternal age and fetal 
NT the presence of megacystis increases the likelihood for 
trisomy 13 or 18 by a factor of 6.7. 
Exomphalos 
At 11–13+6 weeks the prevalence of exomphalos (Figure 4) is 
about 1 in 1000, which is four times higher than in live births. 
The incidence of chromosomal defects, mainly trisomy 18, is 
about 60%, compared to about 30% at mid-gestation and 15% in 
neonates. The risk for trisomy 18 increases with maternal age 
and, since this trisomy is associated with a high rate of intrauterine 
death, its prevalence decreases with gestational age. In contrast, 
the rate of fetal death in chromosomally normal fetuses with 
exomphalos is not higher than in fetuses without this abnormality. 
Consequently, the prevalence of exomphalos and the associated

risk for chromosomal defects increase with maternal age and 
decrease with gestational age (Snijders et al 1995). 
Choroid plexus cysts, pyelectasis and cardiac echogenic foci 
At 11–14 weeks the prevalences of choroid plexus cysts, 
pyelectasis and cardiac echogenic foci were 2.2, 0.9 and 0.6% 
(Whitlow et al 1998). Preliminary results suggest that, as in the 
second trimester, the prevalence of these markers may be higher 
in chromosomally abnormal than normal fetuses. However, 
calculation of likelihood ratios requires the study of many 
more chromosomally abnormal fetuses to determine the true 
prevalence of these markers. 
Placental volume 
The placental volume, determined at 11–13+6 by 3D ultrasound, 
increases with fetal crown-rump length. In trisomy 21 fetuses, 
Chapter 2 • Sonographic features of chromosomal defects 

placental volume is not significantly different from normal but 
in trisomy 18 placental volume is substantially decreased. 
Fetal heart rate 
In normal pregnancy, the fetal heart rate (FHR) increases 
from about 100 bpm at 5 weeks of gestation to 170 bpm at 10 
weeks and then decreases to 155 bpm by 14 weeks. At 10–13+6 
weeks, trisomy 13 and Turner syndrome are associated with 
tachycardia, whereas in trisomy 18 and triploidy there is fetal 
bradycardia (Figure 5; Liao et al 2001). In trisomy 21, there is 
a mild increase in FHR. Measurement of FHR is unlikely

Doppler in the ductus venosus 
The ductus venosus is a unique shunt directing well-oxygenated 
blood from the umbilical vein to the coronary and cerebral 
circulations by preferential streaming through the foramen ovale 
into the left atrium. Blood flow in the ductus has a characteristic 
waveform with high velocity during ventricular systole (S-wave) 
and diastole (D-wave), and forward flow during atrial contraction 
(a-wave). In the second and third trimesters of pregnancy 
abnormal flow with absent or reverse a-wave is observed in 
impending or overt cardiac failure. 
At 10–13+6 weeks abnormal ductal flow (Figure 6) is associated 
with chromosomal defects, cardiac abnormalities and adverse 
pregnancy outcome (Matias et al 1998, Borrell et al 2003). 
Studies from specialist centres, in more than 5,000 pregnancies, 
including about 280 fetuses with trisomy 21, have demonstrated 
that at 10–13+6 weeks there is abnormal flow in the ductus 
venosus in about 80% of trisomy 21 fetuses and in about 5% 
of chromosomally normal fetuses (Nicolaides 2004). There is 
no or only a weak association between increased fetal NT and 
the incidence of abnormal ductal flow. These findings indicate 
that assessment of the ductus venosus can be combined with 
measurement of fetal NT to improve the effectiveness of early 
sonographic screening for trisomy 21. 
Examination of ductal flow is time-consuming and requires 
highly skilled operators and at present it is uncertain if this 
assessment will be incorporated into the routine first-trimester 
scan. However, it could be used in specialist centres to

Abnormal flow in the ductus venosus and chromosomal defects 
•At 11–13+6 weeks abnormal ductal flow is observed in 5% 
of chromosomally normal fetuses and in about 80% of fetuses 
with trisomy 21. 
•Assessment of the ductus venosus can be combined with 
measurement of fetal NT to improve the effectiveness of early 
sonographic screening for trisomy 21. 
•Examination of ductal flow is time-consuming and requires 
highly skilled operators. It is therefore unlikely to be used in 
routine screening, but it could be used in specialist centres to 
re-evaluate the risk in patients with borderline results after 
screening by fetal NT and maternal serum biochemistry. 
The 11–13+6 weeks scan 

Doppler in other vessels 
Uterine arteries 
Uterine artery Doppler studies at 11–13+6 weeks found no significant 
differences in pulsatility index between chromosomally 
normal and abnormal fetuses. Consequently, the high rates of 
fetal death and fetal growth restriction of the major chromosomal 
defects are unlikely to be the consequence of impaired placentation 
in the first trimester of pregnancy. Uterine artery Doppler is not a 
useful screening test for chromosomal defects. 
Umbilical artery 
Umbilical artery Doppler is not useful in screening for trisomy 21. 
However, in trisomy 18, impedance to flow is increased and in 
about 20% of cases there is persistent reversal of end-diastolic flow 
(REDF). 
Umbilical vein 
In second and third-trimester fetuses, pulsatile umbilical venous 
flow is a late and ominous sign of fetal compromise. At 11–13+6 
weeks there is pulsatile flow in the umbilical vein in about 
25% of chromosomally normal fetuses and in 90% of fetuses 
with trisomy 18 or 13. However, in fetuses with trisomy 21, the 
prevalence of pulsatile venous flow is not significantly different 
from that in chromosomally normal fetuses. 
Jugular vein and carotid artery 
There are no significant associations between the pulsatility index 
in the fetal jugular vein and carotid artery and fetal NT and 
no significant differences between the chromosomally normal 
and abnormal fetuses. 
Chapter 2 • Sonographic features of chromosomal defects 

SECOND TRIMESTER ULTRASONOGRAPHY 
In the second trimester scan, as in the first trimester, each chromosomal 
defect has its own syndromal pattern of detectable abnormalities 
( Table 1; Snijders and Nicolaides 1996, Nicolaides et al 
1992). It is therefore recommended that, when an abnormality/ 
marker is detected at routine ultrasound examination, a thorough 
check is made for the other features of the chromosomal defect 
known to be associated with that marker; should additional 
abnormalities be identified, the risk is dramatically increased. In 
the case of apparently isolated abnormalities, the decision of

Second trimester scan: phenotypic expression of chromosomal 
defects 
•Trisomy 21 is associated with nasal hypoplasia, increased 
nuchal fold thickness, cardiac defects, intracardiac echogenic 
foci, duodenal atresia and echogenic bowel, hydronephrosis, 
shortening of the femur and more so of the humerus, sandal 
gap and clinodactyly or mid-phalanx hypoplasia of the fifth 
finger. 
•Trisomy 18 is associated with strawberry-shaped head, choroid 
plexus cysts, absent corpus callosum, enlarged cisterna magna, 
facial cleft, micrognathia, nuchal edema, heart defects, diaphragmatic 
hernia, esophageal atresia, exomphalos, usually 
with bowel only in the sac, single umbilical artery, renal 
abnormalities, echogenic bowel, myelomeningocoele, growth 
restriction and shortening of the limbs, radial aplasia, 
overlapping fingers and talipes or rocker bottom feet. 
•Trisomy 13 is associated with holoprosencephaly, microcephaly, 
facial abnormalities, cardiac abnormalities, enlarged 
and echogenic kidneys, exomphalos and post axial polydactyly. 
•Triploidy where the extra set of chromosomes is paternally 
derived is associated with a molar placenta and the pregnancy 
rarely persists beyond 20 weeks. When there is a double 
maternal chromosome contribution, the pregnancy may persist 
into the third trimester. The placenta is of normal consistency 
but thin and the fetus demonstrates severe asymmetrical 
growth restriction. Commonly there is mild ventriculomegaly, 
micrognathia, cardiac abnormalities, myelomeningocoele, 
syndactyly, and ‘hitch-hiker’ toe deformity. 
•Turner syndrome is associated with large nuchal cystic hygromas, 
generalised edema, mild pleural effusions and ascites, 
cardiac abnormalities and horseshoe kidneys, which are 
suspected by the ultrasonographic appearance of bilateral 
mild hydronephrosis. 
Chapter 2 • Sonographic features of chromosomal defects 

Ventriculomegaly 
The birth prevalence of ventriculomegaly is about 1 per 
1,000. Causes include chromosomal and genetic defects, brain 
hemorrhage or infection but in many cases no clear-cut etiology 
is identified. The overall prevalence of chromosomal defects 
in fetal ventriculomegaly is about 10% and the commonest 
chromosomal defects are trisomies 21, 18, 13 and triploidy. The 
prevalence of chromosomal defects is higher in those with mild 
to moderate, rather than severe ventriculomegaly. 
Holoprosencephaly 
The birth prevalence of holoprosencephaly is about 1 per 10,000. 
Although in many cases the cause is a chromosomal defect or a 
genetic disorder in the majority of cases the etiology is unknown. 
The overall prevalence of chromosomal defects in fetal holoprosencephaly 
is about 30% and the commonest chromosomal 
defects are trisomies 13 and 18. Holoprosencephaly is commonly 
associated with a wide variety of mid-facial abnormalities but 
the incidence of chromosomal defects in only increased in fetuses 
with holoprosencephaly and extrafacial abnormalities but not 
in those where the holoprosencephaly is either isolated or it is 
associated with facial abnormalities only. 
Choroid plexus cysts 
These are found in approximately 2% of fetuses at 16–24 weeks 
of gestation but in more than 95% of cases they resolve by 28 
weeks and are of no pathological significance. There is an association 
between choroid plexus cysts and chromosomal defects, 
particularly trisomy 18. However, the vast majority of fetuses 
with trisomy 18 have multiple other abnormalities and therefore, 
the detection of fetal choroid plexus cysts should stimulate 
the sonographer to search for the other features of trisomy 18. If 
The 11–13+6 weeks scan 

the cysts are apparently isolated the risk for trisomy 18 is only 
marginally increased. 
Dandy-Walker complex 
This refers to a spectrum of abnormalities of the cerebellar 
vermis, cystic dilatation of the fourth ventricle and enlargement 
of the cisterna magna. The condition is classified into Dandy-
Walker malformation (complete or partial agenesis of the cerebellar 
vermis and enlarged posterior fossa), Dandy-Walker variant 
(partial agenesis of the cerebellar vermis without enlargement 
of the posterior fossa) and mega-cisterna magna (normal vermis 
and fourth ventricle). The birth prevalence of Dandy-Walker 
malformation is about 1 per 30,000. Causes include chromosomal 
defects, more than 50 genetic syndromes, congenital infections 
or teratogens such as warfarin, but it can also be an isolated 
finding. The overall prevalence of chromosomal defects is about 
40%, usually trisomies 18 or 13 and triploidy. 
Facial cleft 
Cleft lip and/or palate is found in approximately 1 per 800 live 
births, and both genetic and environmental factors are implicated 
in their causation. Postnatally, chromosomal defects are found 
in less than 1% of babies with facial cleft. However, in prenatal 
series the prevalence is about 20%, most commonly trisomies 
13 and 18. This apparent discrepancy is because in the prenatal 
studies the populations examined are pre-selected and include 
many fetuses with multiple other abnormalities. 
Micrognathia 
The birth prevalence of micrognathia is about 1 per 1,000. This 
is a non-specific finding in a wide range of genetic syndromes 
and chromosomal defects, mainly trisomy 18 and triploidy. 
Chapter 2 • Sonographic features of chromosomal defects 

In two studies reporting on fetal micrognathia the prevalence 
of chromosomal defects was about 60% but all fetuses had 
additional malformations and/or growth restriction. 
Nasal hypoplasia 
Sonographic studies at 15–24 weeks of gestation reported that 
about 65% of trisomy 21 fetuses have nasal bone hypoplasia, 
defined by a nasal bone that is not visible or with a length of less 
than 2.5 mm (Sonek and Nicolaides 2002, Cicero et al 2003). In 
chromosomally normal fetuses, the prevalence of nasal hypoplasia 
is related to the ethnic origin of the mothers, being less than 
1% in Caucasians and up to 10% in African-Caribbeans. It is 
premature to speculate on the precise detection rates that could 
be achieved in the second trimester by a combination of maternal 
age, serum biochemistry and ultrasound examination for the fetal 
nasal bone and other sonographic markers. Nevertheless, on the 
basis of currently available data, nasal hypoplasia is likely to be 
the single most sensitive and specific second trimester marker of 
trisomy 21. 
Diaphragmatic hernia 
The birth prevalence of diaphragmatic hernia is about 1 per 
4,000 and the condition is usually sporadic. The prevalence of 
chromosomal defects, mainly trisomy 18, is about 20%. 
Cardiac abnormalities 
Abnormalities of the heart and great arteries are found in 4–7 
per 1,000 live births and in about 30 per 1,000 stillbirths. The 
etiology of heart abnormalities is heterogeneous and probably 
depends on the interplay of multiple genetic and environmental 
factors. Heart abnormalities are found in more than 90% of 
The 11–13+6 weeks scan 

fetuses with trisomy 18 or 13 and 40% of those with trisomy 
21 or Turner syndrome. Prenatal studies of ultrasonographically 
detectable fetal cardiac abnormalities, have reported chromosomal 
defects in about 25% of cases. 
Exomphalos 
The birth prevalence of exomphalos is about 1 per 4,000. The 
condition is usually sporadic but in some cases there may be 
an associated genetic syndrome. Chromosomal defects, mainly 
trisomies 18 and 13, are found in about 30% of cases at mid-
gestation and in 15% of neonates. The prevalence of chromosomal 
defects is four-times higher when the exomphalos sac 
contains only bowel than in cases where the liver is included. 
Esophageal atresia 
The birth prevalence of esophageal atresia is about 1 per 3,000. 
In 90% of cases there is an associated tracheoesophageal fistula. 
The condition is sporadic. Chromosomal defects are found in 
3–4% of affected neonates. Prenatally, chromosomal defects, 
mainly trisomy 18, are found in about 20% of cases. 
Duodenal atresia 
The birth prevalence of duodenal atresia or stenosis is about 1 
per 5,000. In most cases the condition is sporadic, although in 
some cases there is an autosomal recessive pattern of inheritance. 
Trisomy 21 is found in about 40% of cases. 
Urinary tract abnormalities 
Prenatal studies have established that urinary tract abnormalities 
are commonly found in many chromosomal defects. The risk for 
Chapter 2 • Sonographic features of chromosomal defects 

chromosomal defects is similar for fetuses with unilateral or 
bilateral involvement, different types of renal abnormalities, 
urethral or ureteric obstruction, and oligohydramnios or normal 
amniotic fluid volume. However, the prevalence of chromosomal 
abnormalities in females is double that in males. The pattern 
of chromosomal defects, and consequently that of associated 
malformations, is related to the different types of renal 
abnormalities. Thus, in mild hydronephrosis, the commonest 
chromosomal defect is trisomy 21, whereas in moderate/severe 
hydronephrosis, multicystic kidneys, or renal agenesis the 
commonest defects are trisomies 18 and 13. 
Limb abnormalities 
Trisomies 21, 18, triploidy and Turner syndrome are associated 
with relative shortening of the long bones. Syndactyly is associated 
with triploidy, clinodactyly and sandal gap with trisomy 21, 
polydactyly with trisomy 13, overlapping fingers, rocker bottom 
feet and talipes with trisomy 18. 
Fetal growth restriction 
Low birth weight is a common feature of many chromosomal 
defects, but the prevalence of chromosomal defects in small for 
gestational age neonates is only about 1%. However, data derived 
from postnatal studies underestimate the association between 
chromosomal defects and growth restriction, since many pregnancies 
with chromosomally abnormal fetuses result in spontaneous 
abortion or intrauterine death. The commonest chromosomal 
defects associated with growth restriction are triploidy and 
trisomy 18. 
The highest prevalence of chromosomal defects is found in those 
cases where in addition to the growth restriction there are fetal 
structural abnormalities, the amniotic fluid volume is normal or 
The 11–13+6 weeks scan 

increased and in the group with normal Doppler flow velocity 
waveforms from both uterine and umbilical arteries. Therefore, 
growth restriction due to chromosomal defects presents differently 
from growth restriction due to placental insufficiency, which is 
characterized by reduced amniotic fluid volume and increased 
impedance to flow in the uterine and/or umbilical arteries with 
redistribution in the fetal circulation. 
Major abnormalities 
If the second trimester scan demonstrates major abnormalities, it 
is advisable to offer fetal karyotyping, even if these abnormalities 
are apparently isolated. The prevalence of such abnormalities is 
low and therefore the cost implications are small. 
If the abnormalities are either lethal or they are associated with 
severe handicap, such as holoprosencephaly, fetal karyotyping 
constitutes one of a series of investigations to determine the 
possible cause and thus the risk of recurrence. 
If the abnormality is potentially correctable by intrauterine 
or postnatal surgery, such as diaphragmatic hernia, it may be 
logical to exclude an underlying chromosomal defect – especially 
because, for many of these conditions, the usual defect is trisomy 
18 or 13. 
Minor abnormalities or soft markers 
Minor fetal abnormalities or soft markers are common and they 
are not usually associated with any handicap, unless there is an 
underlying chromosomal defect. Routine karyotyping of all pregnancies 
with these markers would have major implications, both 
in terms of miscarriage and in economic costs. It is best to base 
counseling on an individual estimated risk for a chromosomal 
Chapter 2 • Sonographic features of chromosomal defects 

defect, rather than the arbitrary advice that invasive testing is 
recommended because the risk is ‘high’. 
The estimated risk can be derived by multiplying the a priori 
risk (based on maternal age, gestational age, history of previously 
affected pregnancies and, where appropriate, the results of 
previous screening by NT and/or biochemistry in the current 
pregnancy) by the likelihood ratio of the specific abnormality or 
marker. 
The best estimates of both the positive and negative likelihood 
ratios for each of the common markers of trisomy 21 are given 
in Table 2 (Nyberg et al 2001, Bromley et al 2002, Nicolaides 
2003). 
Major or minor abnormalities are found in about 75% of fetuses 
with trisomy 21 and in 10–15% of chromosomally normal 
fetuses. On the basis of these data the likelihood ratio for trisomy 
21 if there is no detectable abnormality or marker is 0.30. 
In each case the likelihood ratio is derived by dividing the 
prevalence of a given marker in trisomy 21 pregnancies by its 
prevalence in chromosomally normal pregnancies. For example, 
an intracardiac echogenic focus is found in 28.2% of trisomy 
21 fetuses and in 4.4% chromosomally normal fetuses, resulting 
in a positive likelihood ratio of 6.41 (28.2 / 4.4) and a negative 
likelihood ratio of 0.75 (71.8 / 95.6). Consequently, the finding 
of an echogenic focus increases the background risk by a factor 
of 6.41, but at the same time absence of this marker should 
reduce the risk by 25%. 
The same logic applies to each one of the six markers in Table 2. 
Thus, in a 25 year old woman undergoing an ultrasound scan 
at 20 weeks of gestation the a priori risk is about 1 in 1,000. If 
the scan demonstrates an intracardiac echogenic focus, but the 
nuchal fold is not increased, the humerus and femur are not

(6.41×0.67×0.68×0.62×0.85×0.87×0.79) and consequently 
her risk remains at about 1 in 1,000. The same is true if the 
only abnormal finding is mild hydronephrosis (likelihood ratio 
of 1). In contrast, if the fetus is found to have both an intracardiac 
echogenic focus and mild hydronephrosis but no other 
abnormalities the combined likelihood ratio should be 8.42 
(6.41×6.77×0.67×0.68×0.62×0.87×0.79) and consequently 
the risk is increased from 1 in 1,000 to 1 in 119. 
Chapter 2 • Sonographic features of chromosomal defects 

There are no data on the interrelation between these second-
trimester ultrasound markers and fetal NT or maternal serum 
free b-hCG or PAPP-A at 11–13+6 weeks. However, there is 
no obvious physiological reason for such an interrelation and it 
is therefore reasonable to assume that they are independent. 
Consequently, in estimating the risk in a pregnancy with a 
marker, it is logical to take into account the results of previous 
screening tests. For example, in a 32-year-old woman at 20 weeks 
of gestation (background risk of 1 in 559), who had an 11–13+6 
week assessment by NT measurement that resulted in a 7-fold 
reduction in risk (to 1 in 3913), after the diagnosis of isolated 
echogenic bowel at the 20-week scan, the estimated risk would 
increase by a factor of three to 1 in 1304. However, for the same 
ultrasound finding in the absence of prior NT screening the risk 
would increase from 1 in 559 to 1 in 186. 
There are some exceptions to this process of sequential screening, 
which assumes independence between the findings of different 
screening results. The findings of nuchal edema or a cardiac 
defect at the mid-trimester scan cannot be considered independently 
of NT screening at 11–13+6 weeks.

INCREASED NUCHAL TRANSLUCENCY WITH 
NORMAL KARYOTYPE 
Increased fetal NT thickness is a common phenotypic expression 
of trisomy 21 and other chromosomal abnormalities, but it is 
also associated with fetal death and a wide range of fetal malformations, 
deformations, dysgeneses, and genetic syndromes. This 
chapter reviews the outcome of chromosomally normal fetuses 
with increased NT. On the basis of these data it is possible to 
estimate, for each NT group, the chances of intrauterine survival 
and delivery of a healthy baby with no major abnormalities. 
These data are useful in counselling parents of pregnancies with 
increased fetal NT and in planning the appropriate follow-up 
investigations. 
In normal fetuses NT thickness increases with fetal crown-rump 
length (CRL). The median and 95th centile of NT at a CRL of 
45 mm are 1.2, and 2.1 mm and the respective values at CRL of 
84 mm are 1.9 and 2.7 mm (Snijders et al 1998). The 99th centile 
does not change significantly with CRL and it is about 3.5 mm. 
Increased NT, refers to a measurement above the 95th centile and 
the term is used irrespective of whether the collection of fluid 
is septated or not and whether it is confined to the neck or 
envelopes the whole fetus. After 14 weeks, increased NT usually 
resolves but in some cases it evolves into nuchal edema or cystic 
hygromas.

OUTCOME OF FETUSES WITH INCREASED NUCHAL TRANSLUCENCY 
The relation between NT thickness and the prevalence of 
chromosomal defects, miscarriage or fetal death and major fetal 
abnormalities is summarized in Table 1 (Souka et al 2004). 
Chromosomal defects 
The prevalence of chromosomal defects increases exponentially 
with NT thickness (Table 1; Snijders et al 1998). In the chromosomally 
abnormal group, about 50% have trisomy 21, 25% 
have trisomy 18 or 13, 10% have Turner syndrome, 5% have 
triploidy and 10% have other chromosomal defects. 
Fetal death 
In chromosomally normal fetuses, the prevalence of fetal death 
increases exponentially with NT thickness from 1.3% in those 
The 11–13+6 weeks scan 

with NT between the 95th and 99th centiles to about 20% for NT 
of 6.5 mm or more (Table 1; Souka et al 2001, Michailidis 
and Economides 2001). The majority of fetuses that die do so by 
20 weeks and they usually show progression from increased NT 
to severe hydrops. 
Fetal abnormalities 
Major fetal abnormalities are defined as those requiring medical 
and/or surgical treatment or conditions associated with mental 
handicap. Several studies have reported that increased fetal NT 
is associated with a high prevalence of major fetal abnormalities. 
In the combined data of 28 studies on a total of 6153 chromosomally 
normal fetuses with increased NT the prevalence of 
major abnormalities was 7.3% (Souka et al 2004) However, there 
were large differences between the studies in the prevalence 
of major abnormalities, ranging from 3% to 50%, because of 
differences in their definition of the minimum abnormal NT 
thickness, which ranged from 2 mm to 5 mm. 
The prevalence of major fetal abnormalities in chromosomally 
normal fetuses increases with NT thickness, from 1.6%, in those 
with NT below the 95th centile, to 2.5% for NT between the 95th 
and 99th centiles and exponentially thereafter to about 45% for 
NT of 6.5 mm or more (Table 1; Souka et al 2001, Michailidis 
and Economides 2001). 
Developmental delay 
Studies on the long term follow up of chromosomally and 
anatomically normal fetuses with increased NT reported that the 
prevalence of developmental delay is 2–4% (Souka et al 2004). 
Chapter 3 • Increased nuchal translucency with normal karyotype 

However, it is difficult to assess the true significance of these 
findings because only one of the studies had a control group for 
comparison. Brady et al (1998), performed a clinical follow up 
study of 89 children that in fetal life had NT of 3.5 mm or more 
and 302 children whose fetal NT was less than 3.5 mm. Delay in 
achievement of developmental milestones was observed in one of 
the children in each group. 
ABNORMALITIES ASSOCIATED WITH INCREASED NT 
A wide range of fetal abnormalities have been reported in fetuses 
with increased NT and these are summarized in Table 2. 
The observed prevalence for some of the abnormalities, such 
as anencephaly, holoprosencephaly, gastroschisis, renal abnormalities 
and spina bifida, may not be different from that in the 
general population. However, the prevalence of major cardiac 
abnormalities, diaphragmatic hernia, exomphalos, body stalk 
anomaly, skeletal abnormalities, and certain genetic syndromes, 
such as congenital adrenal hyperplasia, fetal akinesia deformation 
sequence, Noonan syndrome, Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome and 
spinal muscular atrophy, appears to be substantially higher than 
in the general population and it is therefore likely that there is a 
true association between these abnormalities and increased NT. 
Cardiac defects 
There is a high association between increased NT and cardiac 
defects in both chromosomally abnormal and normal fetuses 
(Hyett et al 1997, 1999). Eight studies have reported on the 
screening performance of NT thickness for the detection of 
cardiac defects (Souka et al 2004). In total, 67,256 pregnancies

were examined and the prevalence of major cardiac defects was 
2.4 per 1,000. For a false positive rate of 4.9%, the detection rate 
of cardiac defects was 37.5%. 
A meta-analysis of screening studies reported that the detection 
rates were about 37% and 31% for the respective NT cut-offs 
of the 95th and 99th centiles (Makrydimas et al 2003). In 
chromosomally normal fetuses, the prevalence of major cardiac 
defects increases exponentially with NT thickness from 1.6 per 
1,000 in those with NT below the 95th centile, to about 1% for 
NT of 2.5–3.4 mm, 3% for NT of 3.5–4.4 mm, 7% for NT of 
4.5–5.4 mm, 20% for NT of 5.5–6.4 mm and 30% for NT of 
6.5 mm or more (Souka et al 2004). 
The clinical implication of these findings is that increased NT 
constitutes an indication for specialist fetal echocardiography. 
Certainly, the overall prevalence of major cardiac defects in such 
a group of fetuses (1–2%) is similar to that found in pregnancies 
affected by maternal diabetes mellitus or with a history of a 
previously affected offspring, which are well accepted indications 
for fetal echocardiography. 
At present, there may not be sufficient facilities for specialist 
fetal echocardiography to accommodate the potential increase in 
demand if the 95th centile of nuchal translucency thickness is 
used as the cut-off for referral. In contrast, a cut-off of the 99th 
centile would result in only a small increase in workload and, in 
this population the prevalence of major cardiac defects would be 
very high. 
Patients identified by NT scanning as being at high risk for 
cardiac defects need not wait until 20 weeks for specialist echocardiography. 
Improvements in the resolution of ultrasound 
machines have now made it possible to undertake detailed 
The 11–13+6 weeks scan 

cardiac scanning in the first trimester of pregnancy. A specialist 
scan from 13 weeks can effectively reassure the majority of 
parents that there is no major cardiac defect. In the cases with 
a major defect, the early scan can either lead to the correct 
diagnosis or at least raise suspicions so that follow-up scans are 
carried out. 
The best strategy of screening for major cardiac abnormalities 
is to carry out specialist fetal echocardiography in patients with 
increased NT at 11–13+6 weeks and in those with an abnormal 
four-chamber view in the routine mid-trimester scan. These 
two indications are complimentry. Thus, major defects, such 
as tetralogy of Fallot, transposition of the great arteries and 
coarctation of the aorta are rarely detected by routine examination 
of the four-chamber view. However, a high proportion of these 
abnormalities present with increased NT. 
Body stalk anomaly 
This lethal, sporadic abnormality is found in about 1 in 10,000 
fetuses at 10–13+6 weeks. The ultrasonographic features are 
major abdominal wall defect, severe kyphoscoliosis and short 
umbilical cord with a single artery (Daskalakis et al 1997). The 
upper half of the fetal body is seen in the amniotic cavity, whereas 
the lower part is in the celomic cavity, suggesting that early 
amnion rupture before obliteration of the celomic cavity is a possible 
cause of the syndrome. Although the fetal NT is increased 
in about 85% of the cases, the karyotype is usually normal. 
Diaphragmatic hernia 
Increased NT thickness is present in about 40% of fetuses with 
diaphragmatic hernia, including more than 80% of those that 
Chapter 3 • Increased nuchal translucency with normal karyotype 

result in neonatal death due to pulmonary hypoplasia and in 
about 20% of the survivors (Sebire et al 1997). It is possible 
that in fetuses with diaphragmatic hernia and increased NT the 
intrathoracic herniation of the abdominal viscera occurs in the 
first trimester and prolonged compression of the lungs causes 
pulmonary hypoplasia. In the cases where diaphragmatic hernia 
is associated with a good prognosis, the intrathoracic herniation 
of viscera may be delayed until the second or third trimesters of 
pregnancy. 
Exomphalos 
At 11–13+6 weeks the incidence of exomphalos is about 1 in 
1,000 and the incidence of chromosomal defects, mainly trisomy 
18, is about 60% (Snijders et al 1995). Increased NT is 
observed in about 85% of chromosomally abnormal and 40% 
of chromosomally normal fetuses with exomphalos. 
Megacystis 
Fetal megacystis at 11–13+6 weeks of gestation, defined by a 
longitudinal bladder diameter of 7 mm or more, is found 
in about 1 in 1,500 pregnancies. Megacystis is associated with 
increased NT, which is observed in about 75% of those with 
chromosomal abnormalities, mainly trisomy 13, and in about 
30% of those with normal karyotype (Liao et al 2003).

PATHOPHYSIOLOGY OF INCREASED FETAL NT 
The heterogeneity of conditions associated with increased NT 
suggests that there may not be a single underlying mechanism for 
the collection of fluid under the skin of the fetal neck. Possible 
mechanisms include cardiac dysfunction, venous congestion in 
the head and neck, altered composition of the extracellular 
matrix, failure of lymphatic drainage, fetal anemia or hypoproteinemia 
and congenital infection. 
Pathophysiology of increased nuchal translucency 
•Cardiac dysfunction 
•Venous congestion in the head and neck 
•Altered composition of the extracellular matrix 
•Failure of lymphatic drainage 
•Fetal anemia 
•Fetal hypoproteinemia 
•Fetal infection. 
Cardiac dysfunction 
Central to the hypothesis that heart failure contributes to 
increased NT is the observation that in both chromosomally 
abnormal and normal fetuses there is a high association between 
increased NT and abnormalities of the heart and great arteries. 
Furthermore, Doppler studies have reported abnormal flow in 
the ductus venosus in fetuses with chromosomal and/or major 
cardiac defects and increased NT (Matias et al 1999). 
Venous congestion in the head and neck 
Venous congestion in the head and neck could result from 
constriction of the fetal body as encountered in amnion rupture 
Chapter 3 • Increased nuchal translucency with normal karyotype 

sequence, superior mediastinal compression found in diaphragmatic 
hernia or the narrow chest in skeletal dysplasias. However, 
in at least some of the cases of skeletal dysplasias, such as 
osteogenesis imperfecta, an additional or alternative mechanism 
for the increased NT may be the altered composition of the 
extracellular matrix. 
Altered composition of the extracellular matrix 
Many of the component proteins of the extracellular matrix are 
encoded on chromosomes 21, 18 or 13. Immunohistochemical 
studies, examining the skin of chromosomally abnormal fetuses, 
have demonstrated specific alterations of the extracellular matrix 
which may be attributed to gene dosage effects (von Kaisenberg 
et al 1998). Altered composition of the extracellular matrix may 
also be the underlying mechanism for increased fetal NT in an 
expanding number of genetic syndromes, which are associated 
with alterations in collagen metabolism (such as achondrogenesis 
type II, Nance–Sweeney syndrome, osteogenesis imperfecta 
type II), abnormalities of fibroblast growth factor receptors (such 
as achondroplasia and thanatophoric dysplasia) or disturbed 
metabolism of peroxisome biogenesis factor (such as Zellweger 
syndrome). 
Failure of lymphatic drainage 
A possible mechanism for increased NT is dilatation of the 
jugular lymphatic sacs, because of developmental delay in the 
connection with the venous system, or a primary abnormal dilatation 
or proliferation of the lymphatic channels interfering with 
a normal flow between the lymphatic and venous systems. 
Immunohistochemical studies in nuchal skin tissue from fetuses 
The 11–13+6 weeks scan 

with Turner syndrome have shown that the lymphatic vessels in 
the upper dermis are hypoplastic (von Kaisenberg et al 1999). 
In chromosomally normal fetuses with increased NT, deficient 
lymphatic drainage, due to hypoplastic or aplastic lymphatic 
vessels, is found in association with Noonan syndrome and 
congenital lymphedema. In congenital neuromuscular disorders, 
such as fetal akinesia deformation sequence, myotonic dystrophy 
and spinal muscular atrophy, increased NT may be the consequence 
of impaired lymphatic drainage due to reduced fetal 
movements. 
Fetal anemia 
Fetal anemia is associated with a hyperdynamic circulation and 
fetal hydrops develops when the hemoglobin deficit is more than 
7 g/dL (Nicolaides et al 1988). This is true for both immune and 
non-immune hydrops fetalis. However, in red blood cell isoimmunization 
severe fetal anemia does not occur before 16 weeks of 
gestation, presumably because the fetal reticuloendothelial system 
is too immature to result in destruction of antibody coated 
erythrocytes. Consequently, red blood cell isoimmunization does 
not present with increased fetal NT. In contrast, genetic causes 
of fetal anemia (a-thalassemia, Blackfan-Diamond anemia, 
congenital erythropoietic porphyria, dyserythropoietic anemia, 
Fanconi anemia) and possibly congenital infection-related anemia 
can present with increased fetal NT. 
Fetal hypoproteinemia 
Hypoproteinemia is implicated in the pathophysiology of both 
immune and non-immune hydrops fetalis (Nicolaides et al 
1995). In the first trimester, hypoproteinemia due to proteinuria 
Chapter 3 • Increased nuchal translucency with normal karyotype 

may be the underlying mechanism for the increased NT in 
fetuses with congenital nephrotic syndrome. 
Fetal infection 
In about 10% of cases of ‘unexplained’ second- or third-trimester 
fetal hydrops, there is evidence of recent maternal infection 
and, in these cases, the fetus is also infected. In contrast, in 
pregnancies with increased fetal NT and normal karyotype, only 
1.5% of the mothers have evidence of recent infection and the 
fetuses are rarely infected (Sebire et al 1997). 
These findings suggest that, in pregnancies with increased fetal 
NT, the prevalence of maternal infection with the TORCH 
group of organisms is not higher than in the general population. 
Furthermore, in cases of maternal infection, the presence of 
increased fetal NT does not signify the presence of fetal infection 
with these organisms. Therefore, increased NT in chromosomally 
normal fetuses need not stimulate the search for maternal 
infection unless the translucency evolves into second- or third-
trimester nuchal edema or generalized hydrops. 
The only infection that has been reported in association with 
increased NT is Parvovirus B19. In this condition the increased 
NT has been attributed to myocardial dysfunction or fetal 
anemia due to suppression of hemopoiesis. 
MANAGEMENT OF PREGNANCIES WITH INCREASED NT 
The relation between NT thickness and chromosomal defects, 
miscarriage or fetal death and prevalence of major fetal defects is 
summarized in Table 1. On the basis of these data it is possible 
to estimate, for each NT group, the chances of intrauterine

survival and delivery of a healthy baby with no major defects. 
These data are useful in counselling parents of pregnancies with 
increased fetal NT and in planning the appropriate follow-up 
investigations (Figure 1).

Fetal NT below the 99th centile 
In pregnancies with fetal NT below the 99th centile (3.5 mm) 
the decision by the parents in favour or against fetal karyotyping 
will depend on the patient-specific risk for chromosomal defects, 
which is derived from the combination of maternal age, 
sonographic findings and serum free b-hCG and PAPP-A at 
11–13+6 weeks. 
The parents can be reassured that the chances of delivering a 
baby with no major abnormalities is about 97% for NT below the 
95th centile and 93% for NT between the 95th and 99th centiles. 
Furthermore, many of the major fetal abnormalities can be diagnosed 
or suspected at the time of the high-resolution scan at 
11–13+6 weeks. 
Chapter 3 • Increased nuchal translucency with normal karyotype 

In terms of the subsequent management of the pregnancy it 
would be best to carry out a detailed fetal scan at 20 weeks 
to determine fetal growth and diagnose or exclude major 
abnormalities that could not be identified at the 11–13+6 weeks 
scan. 
In the 4% of fetuses with NT between the 95th and 99th centiles, 
special care should be taken to firstly, confirm that the nuchal 
fold thickness is not increased, secondly, to examine the fetal 
anatomy with the knowledge that the prevalence of major abnormalities 
is about 2.5%, rather than 1.6% in those with NT below 
the 95th centile, and thirdly, to examine the fetal heart. It would 
be preferable if specialist fetal echocardiography is carried out 
but the feasibility of this will primarily depend on the availability 
of such service. 
Fetal NT above the 99th centile 
A fetal NT above 3.5 mm is found in about 1% of pregnancies. 
The risk of major chromosomal defects is very high and 
increases from about 20% for NT of 4.0 mm to 33% for NT of 
5.0 mm, 50% for NT of 6.0 mm and 65% for NT of 6.5 mm 
or more. Consequently, the first line of management of such 
pregnancies should be the offer of fetal karyotyping by CVS. 
In patients with a family history of the genetic syndromes which 
are associated with increased NT and are amenable to prenatal 
diagnosis by DNA analysis (Table 3), the CVS sample can also 
be used for the diagnosis or exclusion of these syndromes. In 
addition, a detailed scan should be carried out at 11–13+6 weeks 
in search of the many major abnormalities that have been 
reported in association with increased NT (Table 3). 
The 11–13+6 weeks scan 

Resolution of increased NT 
In the chromosomally normal group, a detailed scan, including 
fetal echocardiography, should be carried out at 14–16 weeks to 
determine the evolution of the NT and to diagnose or exclude 
many fetal defects. If this scan demonstrates resolution of the 
NT and absence of any major abnormalities the parents can be 
reassured that the prognosis is likely to be good and the chances 
of delivering a baby with no major abnormalities is more than 
95%. 
The only necessary additional investigation is a detailed scan at 
20–22 weeks for the exclusion or diagnosis of both major abnormalities 
and the more subtle defects that are associated with the 
genetic syndromes listed in Table 3. If none of these is found, the 
parents can be counseled that the risk of delivering a baby with a 
serious abnormality or neurodevelopmental delay may not be 
higher than in the general population. 
Evolution to nuchal edema 
Persistence of unexplained increased NT at the 14–16 weeks 
scan or evolution to nuchal edema or hydrops fetalis at 20–22 
weeks, raise the possibility of congenital infection or a genetic 
syndrome. Maternal blood should be tested for toxoplasmosis, 
cytomegalovirus, and parvovirus B19. Follow-up scans to define 
the evolution of the edema should be carried out every four 
weeks. Additionally, consideration should be given to DNA 
testing for certain genetic conditions, such as spinal muscular 
atrophy, even if there is no family history for these conditions. 
In pregnancies with unexplained nuchal edema at the 20–22 
weeks scan the parents should be counseled that there is a 10% 
risk of evolution to hydrops and perinatal death or a livebirth

NT of 3.5–4.4 mm, 50% for NT 4.5–5.4 mm, 30% for NT of 
5.5–6.4 mm and 15% for NT of 6.5 mm or more.

increased NT can be diagnosed by a series of investigations 
that can be compled by 14 weeks of gestation.

MULTIPLE PREGNANCY 
Multiple pregnancy results from the ovulation and subsequent 
fertilisation of more than one oocyte. In such case the fetuses 
are genetically different (polyzygotic or non-identical). Multiple 
pregnancy can also result from splitting of one embryonic mass 
to form two or more genetically identical fetuses (monozygotic). 
In all cases of polyzygotic multiple pregnancy each zygote 
develops its own amnion, chorion and placenta (polychorionic). 
In monozygotic pregnancies, there may be sharing of the same 
placenta (monochorionic), amniotic sac (monoamniotic) or even 
fetal organs (conjoined or Siamese). 
When the single embryonic mass splits into two within three days 
of fertilisation, which occurs in one-third of monozygotic twins, 
each fetus has its own amniotic sac and placenta (diamniotic and 
dichorionic) (Figure 1). When embryonic splitting occurs after 
the third day following fertilisation, there are vascular communications 
within the two placental circulations (monochorionic). 
Embryonic splitting after the 9th day following fertilisation results 
in monoamniotic monochorionic twins and splitting after the 12th 
day results in conjoined twins. 
PREVALENCE AND EPIDEMIOLOGY 
Twins account for about 1% of all pregnancies with two-thirds 
being dizygotic and one-third monozygotic.

Figure 1. In monozygotic twins embryonic splitting within the first three days of fertilisation results in a 
diamniotic and dichorionic pregnancy, splitting between days 3 and 9 results in a diamniotic monochorionic 
pregnancy, splitting between days 9 and 12 results in a monoamniotic monochorionic pregnancy, 
and splitting after the 12th day results in conjoined twins. 
The prevalence of dizygotic twins varies with ethnic group (up to 
5-times higher in certain parts of Africa and half as high in parts 
of Asia), maternal age (2% at 35 years), parity (2% after four 
pregnancies) and method of conception (20% with ovulation 
induction). 
The prevalence of monozygotic twins is similar in all ethnic 
groups and does not vary with maternal age or parity, but may 
be 2–3 times higher following in-vitro fertilisation procedures, 
possibly because with these methods the architecture of the zona 
pellucida is altered although the mechanism remains uncertain. 
In the last 20 years the rate of twinning has increased. This 
increase is most marked for dizygotic twins. It is estimated that 
about one third of the increase in multiple births is a consequence 
of childbearing later in life, but the majority of the effect is due to 
the use of assisted reproduction techniques. 
The 11–13+6 weeks scan 

DETERMINATION OF ZYGOSITY AND CHORIONICITY 
Zygosity can only be determined by DNA fingerprinting, which 
requires amniocentesis, chorion villus sampling or cordocentesis. 
Determination of chorionicity can be performed by ultrasonography 
and relies on the assessment of fetal gender, number of 
placentas, and characteristics of the membrane between the two 
amniotic sacs (Monteagudo et al 1994). 
Different-sex twins are dizygotic and therefore dichorionic, but 
in about two-thirds of twin pregnancies the fetuses are of the 
same sex and these may be either monozygotic or dizygotic. 
Similarly, if there are two separate placentas the pregnancy is 
dichorionic, but in the majority of cases the two placentas are 
adjacent to each other and there are often difficulties in distinguishing 
between dichorionic-fused and monochorionic placentas. 
In dichorionic twins the inter-twin membrane is composed of a 
central layer of chorionic tissue sandwiched between two layers of 
amnion, whereas in monochorionic twins there is no chorionic 
layer present. The best way to determine chorionicity is by an 
ultrasound examination at 6–9 weeks of gestation. Dichorionic 
twins can be easily distinguished by the presence of a thick 
septum between the chorionic sacs. This septum becomes progressively 
thinner to form the chorionic component of the inter-
twin membrane, but remains thicker and easier to identify at the 
base of the membrane as a triangular tissue projection, or lambda 
sign (Bessis et al 1981, Sepulveda et al 1996, 1997, Monteagudo 
et al 2000). 
Sonographic examination of the base of the inter-twin membrane 
at 10–13+6 weeks of gestation for the presence or absence of the 
lambda sign (Figure 2) provides reliable distinction between 
dichorionic and monochorionic pregnancies. With advancing 
Chapter 4 • Multiple pregnancy 

Figure 2. Ultrasound appearance of monochorionic (left) and dichorionic (right) twin pregnancies at 
12 weeks of gestation. Note that in both types there appears to be a single placental mass but in the 
dichorionic type there is an extention of placental tissue into the base of the intertwin membrane forming 
the lambda sign. 
gestation there is regression of the chorion laeve and the ‘lambda’ 
sign becomes progressively more difficult to identify. Thus by 20 
weeks only 85% of dichorionic pregnancies demonstrate the 
lambda sign. 
Therefore, absence of the lambda sign at 20 weeks, and presumably 
thereafter, does not constitute evidence of monochorionicity 
and does not exclude the possibility of dichorionicity or dizygosity. 
Conversely, because none of the pregnancies classified as monochorionic 
at the 10–13+6 week scan subsequently develop the 
lambda sign, the identification of this feature at any stage of 
pregnancy should be considered as evidence of dichorionicity. 
CHORIONICITY AND PREGNANCY COMPLICATIONS 
Miscarriage 
In singleton pregnancies with a live fetus demonstrated at the 
11–13+6 weeks scan the rate of subsequent miscarriage or fetal 
The 11–13+6 weeks scan 

death before 24 weeks is about 1%. The rate of fetal loss in 
dichorionic twins is about 2% and in monochorionic twins it 
is about 10% (Sebire et al 1997a). This high mortality confined 
to monochorionic pregnancies is the consequence of severe 
early-onset TTTS. 
Reduction of the excess fetal loss in twins, compared to singletons, 
can only be achieved through early identification of monochorionic 
pregnancies by ultrasound examination at 11–13+6 weeks, 
close surveillance and appropriate treatment, with endoscopic 
laser coagulation of the communicating placental vessels, in those 
that develop severe TTTS (Ville et al 1995, Senat et al 2004). 
Perinatal mortality 
The perinatal mortality rate in twins is about 5-times higher than 
in singletons. This increased mortality, which is mainly due to 
prematurity-related complications, is higher in monochorionic 
(5%) than dichorionic (2%) twin pregnancies (Sebire et al 1997a). 
In monochorionic twins, an additional complication to prematurity 
is TTTS. 
Early preterm delivery 
The most important complication of any pregnancy is delivery 
before term and especially before 32 weeks. Almost all babies 
born before 24 weeks die and almost all born after 32 weeks 
survive. Delivery between 24 and 32 weeks is associated with 
a high chance of neonatal death and handicap in the survivors. 
The chance of spontaneous delivery between 24 and 32 weeks 
is about 1% in singletons, 5% in dichorionic and 10% in 
monochorionic twin pregnancies (Sebire et al 1997a). 
Chapter 4 • Multiple pregnancy 

Growth restriction 
In singleton pregnancies the prevalence of babies with birth 
weight below the 5th centile is 5%, in dichorionic twins it is 
about 20% and in monochorionic twins it is 30% (Sebire et al 
1997a, 1998a). Furthermore, the chance of growth restriction of 
both twins is about 2% in dichorionic and 8% in monochorionic 
pregnancies. 
In singleton pregnancies the two main factors determining fetal 
growth are genetic potential and placental function. In monochorionic 
twin pregnancies both factors should be the same for 
the two fetuses. Consequently, inter-twin disparities in growth 
are likely to reflect the degree of unequal splitting of the initial 
single cell mass or the magnitude of imbalance in the flow of 
fetal blood through placental vascular communications between 
the two circulations. In contrast, since about 90% of dichorionic 
pregnancies are dizygotic, inter-twin disparities in size would be 
due to differences in genetic constitution of the fetuses and their 
placentas. 
Pre-eclampsia 
The prevalence of pre-eclampsia is about 4-times greater in 
twin than in singleton pregnancies but it is not significantly different 
between monochorionic and dichorionic twins (Savvidou 
et al 2001). 
Death of one fetus 
Intrauterine death of a fetus in a twin pregnancy may be associated 
with adverse outcome for the co-twin but the type and 
degree of risk is dependent on the chorionicity of the pregnancy. 
The 11–13+6 weeks scan 

In singleton pregnancies death and retention of the fetus may 
be associated with maternal disseminated intravascular coagulation; 
however, in twin pregnancies with one dead fetus this 
complication has only rarely been reported. 
Death of one fetus in dichorionic pregnancies carries a risk to 
the remaining fetus, mainly due to preterm delivery, which may 
be the consequence of release of cytokines and prostaglandins 
by the resorbing dead placenta. In dichorionic twins the risk of 
death or handicap in such cases is about 5–10% whereas in 
monochorionic twins, there is at least a 30% risk of death or 
neurological handicap to the co-twin due to hypotensive episodes 
in addition to the risk of preterm delivery. The acute hypotensive 
episode is the result of hemorrhage from the live fetus into the 
dead fetoplacental unit (Fusi et al 1991). Intrauterine blood 
transfusion within 24 hours of death of the co-twin may prevent 
fetal death. 
Structural defects 
Structural fetal defects in twin pregnancies can be grouped into 
those which also occur in singletons and those specific to the 
twinning process; the latter being unique to monozygotic twins. 
For any given defect the pregnancy may be concordant or discordant 
in terms of both the presence or type of abnormality and 
its’ severity. The prevalence of structural defects per fetus in 
dizygotic twins is the same as in singletons, whereas the rate in 
monozygotic twins is 2–3 times higher (Burn et al 1991, Baldwin 
et al 1994). Concordance of defects (both fetuses being affected) 
is uncommon, being found in about 10% of dichorionic and 20% 
of monochorionic pregnancies. 
Multiple pregnancies discordant for a fetal abnormality can 
essentially be managed expectantly or by selective fetocide of the 
Chapter 4 • Multiple pregnancy 

abnormal twin (Sebire et al 1997b). In cases where the abnormality 
is non-lethal but may well result in serious handicap the 
parents need to decide whether the potential burden of a handicapped 
child is enough to risk the loss of the normal twin from 
fetocide-related complications. In cases where the abnormality is 
lethal it may be best to avoid such risk to the normal fetus, unless 
the condition itself threatens the survival of the normal twin. 
In the case of dichorionic pregnancies fetocide can be carried 
out by intracardiac injection of potassium chloride, whereas in 
monochorionic pregnancies fetocide necessitates occlusion of the 
umbilical cord vessels. 
Twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome 
In monochorionic twin pregnancies there are placental vascular 
anastomoses which allow communication of the two fetoplacental 
circulations; these anastomoses may be arterio-arterial, venovenous, 
or arterio-venous in nature. Anatomical studies demonstrated 
that arterio-venous anastomoses are deep in the placenta 
but the feeding vessels are invariably superficial (Benirschke et al 
1973). In about 30% of monochorionic twin pregnancies, imbalance 
in the net flow of blood across the placental vascular arteriovenous 
communications from one fetus, the donor, to the other, 
the recipient, results in twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome; in 
about half of these the condition is severe. 
Severe disease, with the development of polyhydramnios, becomes 
apparent at 16–24 weeks of pregnancy. The pathognomonic 
features of severe TTTS by ultrasonographic examination 
are the presence of a large bladder in the polyuric recipient fetus 
in the polyhydramniotic sac and ‘absent’ bladder in the anuric 
donor that is found ‘stuck’ and immobile at an edge of the 
placenta or the uterine wall where it is held fixed by the collapsed 
membranes of the anhydramniotic sac (Figure 3). 
The 11–13+6 weeks scan 

Figure 3. Severe twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome at 20 weeks of gestation. In the polyuric 
recipient there is polyhydramnios and the anuric donor is held fixed to the placenta by the collapsed 
membranes of the anhydramniotic sac. 
Early prediction of twin-to twin transfusion syndrome 
Ultrasonographic features of the underlying hemodynamic 
changes in severe TTTS may be present from as early as 11– 
13+6 weeks of gestation and manifest as increased NT thickness 
in one or both of the fetuses. In monochorionic twin pregnancies 
at 11–13+6, the prevalence of increased NT thickness in at least 
one of the fetuses in those that subsequently develop TTTS is 
about 30%, compared to 10% in those that do not develop 
TTTS (Sebire et al 2000). 
Another early ultrasound marker of severe TTTS may be abnormal 
Doppler flow velocity waveform in the ductus of the recipient 
twin (Matias et al 2000). Intertwin discrepancies in crown-rump 
length are not predictive of subsequent development of TTTS. 
An early manifestation of disparity in amniotic fluid volume due 
to TTTS is inter-twin membrane folding (Figure 4). In about 
Chapter 4 • Multiple pregnancy 

Figure 4. Monochorionic twin pregnancy at 16 weeks of gestation affected by early twin-to-twin transfusion 
syndrome showing folding of the inter-twin membrane, pointing towards the recipient amniotic sac 
and the increased echogenicity of the amniotic fluid in the donor sac. 
30% of monochorionic twin pregnancies at 15–17 weeks of 
gestation there is a membrane folding, and in about half of such 
cases (15% of total) there is progression to the polyhydramnios/ 
anhydramnios sequence of severe TTTS; in the other 15% there 
is moderate TTTS with large discrepancies in amniotic fluid 
volume and fetal size persisting throughout pregnancy (Sebire 
et al 1998b). 
In two-thirds of monochorionic twin pregnancies, there is no 
membrane folding and these pregnancies are not at increased risk 
for miscarriage or perinatal death due to TTTS. 
Twin reversed arterial perfusion sequence 
The most extreme manifestation of twin-to-twin transfusion 
syndrome, found in approximately 1% of monozygotic twin pregnancies, 
is acardiac twinning. This twin disorder has been named 
twin reversed arterial perfusion (TRAP) sequence because the 
underlying mechanism is thought to be disruption of normal 
vascular perfusion and development of the recipient twin due to 
The 11–13+6 weeks scan 

an umbilical arterial-to-arterial anastomosis with the donor or 
pump-twin (Van Allen et al 1983). At least 50% of donor twins 
die due to congestive heart failure or severe preterm delivery, due 
to polyhydramnios. All perfused twins die due to the associated 
multiple malformations. Prenatal treatment is by occlusion of the 
blood flow to the acardiac twin by ultrasound-guided diathermy 
of the umbilical cord or laser coagulation of the umbilical cord 
vessels within the abdomen of the acardiac twin, which is carried 
out at about 16 weeks of gestation. 
Importance of prenatal determination of chorionicity 
•Chorionicity, rather than zygosity, is the main factor determining 
pregnancy outcome. 
•In monochorionic twins the rates of miscarriage, perinatal 
death, preterm delivery, fetal growth restriction and fetal 
abnormalities are much higher than in dichorionic twins. 
•Death of a monochorionic fetus is associated with a high 
chance of sudden death or severe neurological damage in the 
co-twin. 
CHROMOSOMAL DEFECTS IN MULTIPLE PREGNANCIES 
In multiple pregnancies compared to singletons, prenatal diagnosis 
of chromosomal abnormalities is complicated because, 
firstly, the techniques of invasive testing may provide uncertain 
results or may be associated with higher risks of miscarriage and, 
secondly, the fetuses may be discordant for an abnormality, in 
which case one of the options for the subsequent management of 
the pregnancy is selective fetocide. 
Selective fetocide can result in spontaneous abortion or severe 
preterm delivery, which may occur several months after the 
Chapter 4 • Multiple pregnancy 

procedure. The risk for these complications is related to the 
gestation at fetocide. Selective fetocide after 16 weeks is associated 
with a three-fold increase in risk compared to reduction 
before 16 weeks, and there is an inverse correlation between the 
gestational age at fetocide with the gestation at delivery (Evans 
et al 1994). 
Amniocentesis in twins is effective in providing a reliable 
karyotype for both fetuses and the procedure-related fetal loss 
rate is about 2%. In the case of chorionic villus sampling, the 
procedure-related fetal loss rate is about 1%, but in about 1% of 
cases there may be a diagnostic error, either due to sampling the 
same placenta twice or cross-contamination. The main advantage 
of chorionic villus sampling is that it provides results sufficiently 
early to allow for safer selective fetocide. 
Screening by maternal age 
In dizygotic pregnancies, the maternal age-related risk for chromosomal 
abnormalities for each twin is the same as in singleton 
pregnancies and therefore the chance that at least one fetus is 
affected by a chromosomal defect is twice as high as in singleton 
pregnancies. Furthermore, since the rate of dizygotic twinning 
increases with maternal age the proportion of twin pregnancies 
with chromosomal abnormalities is higher than in singleton 
pregnancies. 
In monozygotic twins, the risk for chromosomal abnormalities 
is the same as in singleton pregnancies and in the vast majority 
of cases both fetuses are affected. 
The relative proportion of spontaneous dizygotic to monozygotic 
twins in Caucasian populations is about two-to-one and therefore 
the prevalence of chromosomal abnormalities affecting at least 
The 11–13+6 weeks scan 

one fetus in twin pregnancies would be expected to be about 
1.6 times higher than in singletons.
In counselling parents it is possible to give more specific estimates 
of one and/or both fetuses being affected depending on chorionicity. 
Thus in monochorionic twins the parents can be counseled 
that both fetuses would be affected and this risk is similar to 
that in singleton pregnancies. If the pregnancy is dichorionic, 
then the parents can be counseled that the risk of discordancy 
for a chromosomal abnormality is about twice that in singleton 
pregnancies whereas the risk that both fetuses would be affected 
can be derived by squaring the singleton risk ratio. For example, 
in a 40 year old woman with a risk for trisomy 21 of about 1 in 
100 based on maternal age, in a dizygotic twin pregnancy the risk 
that one fetus would be affected would be 1 in 50 (1 in 100 plus 
1 in 100), whereas the risk that both fetuses would be affected 
is 1 in 10,000 (1 in 100 × 1 in 100). This is in reality an oversimplification, 
since, unlike monochorionic pregnancies that are 
always monozygotic, only about 90% of dichorionic pregnancies 
are dizygotic. 
Screening by second trimester maternal serum biochemistry 
In singleton pregnancies, screening for trisomy 21 by a combination 
of maternal age and second trimester maternal serum 
biochemistry can detect 50–70% of trisomy 21 cases for a 5% false 
positive rate (Cuckle 1998). 
In twin pregnancies, the median value for maternal serum 
markers, such as AFP, hCG, free b-hCG and inhibin-A are about 
twice those for singleton pregnancies. When this is taken into 
account in the mathematical modeling for calculation of risks it 
was estimated that serum screening in twins may identify about 
45% of affected fetuses for a 5% false positive rate (Cuckle 1998). 
Chapter 4 • Multiple pregnancy 

Even if prospective studies demonstrate that serum testing in 
twins is effective, the following problems would still need to 
be addressed; (a) the detection rate for an acceptable low false 
positive rate, especially since invasive testing in multiple pregnancies 
is technically more demanding, (b) in the presence of a 
‘screen positive’ result, there is no feature to suggest which 
fetus may be affected, and (c) if the pregnancy is discordant for 
chromosomal defect, further management by way of selective 
termination carries increased risk in the second compared to 
the first trimester. 
Screening by fetal nuchal translucency thickness 
In dichorionic twin pregnancies, the detection rate (75–80%) and 
false positive rate (5% per fetus or 10% per pregnancy) of fetal 
NT in screening for trisomy 21 are similar to those in singleton 
pregnancies (Sebire et al 1996a, 1996b). Patient specific-risks for 
trisomy 21 are calculated for each fetus based on maternal age 
and fetal NT. Effective screening and diagnosis of major chromosomal 
abnormalities can be achieved in the first trimester, 
allowing the possibility of earlier and therefore safer selective 
fetocide for those parents that choose this option. 
An important advantage of screening by fetal NT in dichorionic 
twins is that when there is discordancy for a chromosomal abnormality, 
the presence of a sonographically detectable marker helps 
to ensure the correct identification of the abnormal twin should 
the parents choose selective termination. 
In monochorionic pregnancies, the false-positive rate of NT 
screening (8% per fetus or 14% per pregnancy) is higher than in 
dichorionic twins, because increased NT is an early manifestation 
of TTTS. The risk for trisomy 21 is calculated for each fetus, 
based on maternal age and fetal NT and then the average risk 
between the two fetuses is considered to be the risk for the 
pregnancy as a whole. 
The 11–13+6 weeks scan 

Screening by fetal NT thickness and maternal serum biochemistry 
In normal twin pregnancies, compared to singletons, the median 
maternal serum free b-hCG and PAPP-A, adjusted for maternal 
weight, are about 2.0 MoM. In trisomy 21 twin pregnancies 
the median level of free b-hCG is significantly higher and 
PAPP-A lower than than in normal twins. At a false positive rate of 
10% (compared to 5% in singletons) screening by a combination 
of fetal NT and maternal serum biochemistry could identify 
85–90% of trisomy 21 pregnancies (Spencer and Nicolaides 
2003). Chorionicity is not associated with significant differences in 
maternal serum free b-hCG or PAPP-A values in first trimester. 
Management of twin pregnancies with chromosomal abnormalities 
When both fetuses are chromosomally abnormal the parents usually 
chose termination of pregnancy. In pregnancies discordant for 
chromosomal defects the main options are either selective fetocide 
or expectant management. In such cases the decision is essentially 
based on the relative risk of selective fetocide causing miscarriage 
and hence death of the normal baby, compared to the potential 
burden of caring for a handicapped child (Sebire et al 1997c). 
Selective fetocide after 16 weeks of gestation is associated with 
three-fold increase in risk of spontaneous abortion compared to 
reduction before 16 weeks and there is and inverse correlation 
between the gestation at fetocide with the gestation at delivery 
(Evans et al 1994). It is possible that the resorbing dead 
fetoplacental tissue triggers an intrauterine inflammatory process 
that is proportional to the amount of dead tissue and therefore 
the gestation at fetocide. Such an inflammatory process could 
result in the release of cytokines and prostaglandins which would 
in turn induce uterine activity with consequent miscarriage/ 
preterm labour. 
Chapter 4 • Multiple pregnancy 

In pregnancies discordant for trisomy 21 the usual choice is 
selective fetocide, because with expectant management the majority 
of affected babies would survive. In the case of more lethal 
defects, such as trisomy 18, about 85% of affected fetuses die 
in-utero and those that are live born usually die within the first 
year of life. In this respect, expectant management may be the 
preferred option; this would certainly avoid the procedure-related 
complications from selective fetocide. The alternative view is that 
the amount of dead fetoplacental tissue (and therefore the risk for 
consequent miscarriage or preterm labour) would be less after 
fetocide at 12 weeks rather than spontaneous death of the trisomy 
18 fetus at a latter stage of pregnancy.
