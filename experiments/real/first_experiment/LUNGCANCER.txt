Risk Factors

Research has found several risk factors for lung cancer. A risk factor is anything that changes the chance of getting a disease. Different risk factors change risk by different amounts.

The risk factors for lung cancer include—

    * Smoking and being around others' smoke.
    * Things around us at home or work, such as radon gas.
    * Personal traits, such as having a family history of lung cancer.

Smoking and Secondhand Smoke

Cigarette smoking causes lung cancer. In fact, smoking tobacco is the major risk factor for lung cancer. In the United States, about 90% of lung cancer deaths in men and almost 80% of lung cancer deaths in women are due to smoking. People who smoke are 10 to 20 times more likely to get lung cancer or die from lung cancer than people who do not smoke. The longer a person smokes and the more cigarettes smoked each day, the more risk goes up. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8

People who quit smoking have a lower risk of lung cancer than if they had continued to smoke, but their risk is higher than the risk for people who never smoked.7 As more people quit smoking, lung cancer rates will continue to fall, the percentage of lung cancers that occur in smokers will decrease, and the percentage of lung cancers that occur in people who have quit will rise.

Smoking also causes cancer of the voicebox (larynx), mouth and throat, esophagus, bladder, kidney, pancreas, cervix, and stomach, and causes acute myeloid leukemia.

More information about cigarette smoking and lung cancer is available in CDC's Smoking and Tobacco Use fact sheets, the 2004 Surgeon General's Report, and the National Cancer Institute's (NCI) Cigarette Smoking and Cancer: Questions and Answers.External Web Site Icon

Using cigars or pipes also increases risk for lung cancer, but not as much as smoking cigarettes. For more information, visit NCI's Questions and Answers About Cigar Smoking and Cancer.External Web Site Icon 2 3 4 8 9 10 11

Smoke from other people's cigarettes (secondhand smoke) causes lung cancer as well. Secondhand smoke contains more than 4,000 chemicals, more than 50 of which cause cancer in people or animals. Every year, about 3,000 nonsmokers die from lung cancer due to secondhand smoke. 5 12 13 14 15 16

Things at Home and Work That May Cause Lung Cancer

Several things may cause lung cancer in the workplace or even in the home—

    * Radon gas causes lung cancer and is sometimes found in people's homes. Radon is an odorless, colorless gas that comes from rocks and dirt and can get trapped in houses and buildings. Radon is the number one cause of lung cancer among non-smokers, according to EPA estimates.External Web Site Icon Overall, radon is the second leading cause of lung cancer.
    * Examples of substances found at some workplaces that increase risk include asbestos, arsenic, and some forms of silica and chromium. For many of these substances, the risk of getting lung cancer is even higher for those who also smoke. 2 3 6 17 18 19
    * Other substances may increase lung cancer risk as well.

Family History

Risk of lung cancer may be higher if a person's parents, siblings (brothers or sisters), or children have had lung cancer. This increased risk could come from one or more things. They may share behaviors, like smoking. They may live in the same place where there are carcinogens such as radon. They may have inherited increased risk in their genes. 20 21 22 23

Diet

Scientists are studying many different foods to see how they may change the risk of getting lung cancer. However, any effect diet may have on lung cancer risk is small compared with the risk from smoking. Eating a lot of fat and cholesterol might increase risk of lung cancer. Drinking a lot of alcohol may raise risk as well. However, it's hard to tell how much of the risk in people who drink is actually due to tobacco smoke, since many people both smoke and drink.

Some foods may actually help prevent lung cancer. Diets high in fruits and vegetables likely decrease cancer risk. Diets high in vitamin C, vitamin E, or selenium also may help protect against lung cancer. The effect of eating foods with carotenoids like beta-carotene on lung cancer risk is uncertain. Carotenoids can be found in carrots, sweet potatoes, and some green vegetables. Eating these foods may lower chances of lung cancer. Taking beta-carotene supplements (pills) is not recommended, however, since it may actually increase risk in some smokers. 6 8 24 25 26 

Smoking causes the majority of lung cancers — both in smokers and in people exposed to secondhand smoke. But lung cancer also occurs in people who never smoked and in those who never had prolonged exposure to secondhand smoke. In these cases, there may be no clear cause of lung cancer. Doctors have identified factors that may increase the risk.

How smoking causes lung cancer
Doctors believe smoking causes lung cancer by damaging the cells that line the lungs. When you inhale cigarette smoke, which is full of cancer-causing substances (carcinogens), changes in the lung tissue begin almost immediately. At first your body may be able to repair this damage. But with each repeated exposure, normal cells that line your lungs are increasingly damaged. Over time, the damage causes cells to act abnormally and eventually cancer may develop.

Types of lung cancer
Doctors divide lung cancer into two major types based on the appearance of lung cancer cells under the microscope. Your doctor makes treatment decisions based on which major type of lung cancer you have. The two general types of lung cancer include:

    * Small cell lung cancer. Small cell lung cancer occurs almost exclusively in heavy smokers and is less common than non-small cell lung cancer.
    * Non-small cell lung cancer. Non-small cell lung cancer is an umbrella term for several types of lung cancers that behave in a similar way. Non-small cell lung cancers include squamous cell carcinoma, adenocarcinoma and large cell carcinoma.


A number of factors may increase your risk of lung cancer. Some risk factors can be controlled, for instance, by quitting smoking. And other factors can't be controlled, such as your sex. Risk factors for lung cancer include:

    * Smoking. Smoking remains the greatest risk factor for lung cancer. Your risk of lung cancer increases with the number of cigarettes you smoke each day and the number of years you have smoked. Quitting at any age can significantly lower your risk of developing lung cancer.
    * Exposure to secondhand smoke. Even if you don't smoke, your risk of lung cancer increases if you're exposed to secondhand smoke.
    * Exposure to radon gas. Radon is produced by the natural breakdown of uranium in soil, rock and water that eventually becomes part of the air you breathe. Unsafe levels of radon can accumulate in any building, including homes. Radon testing can determine whether levels are safe.
    * Exposure to asbestos and other chemicals. Workplace exposure to asbestos and other substances known to cause cancer — such as arsenic, chromium, nickel and tar — also can increase your risk of developing lung cancer, especially if you're a smoker.
    * Family history of lung cancer. People with a parent, sibling or other first-degree relative with lung cancer have an increased risk of the disease.
    * Excessive alcohol use. Drinking more than a moderate amount of alcohol — no more than one drink a day for women or two drinks a day for men — may increase your risk of lung cancer.
    * Certain lung diseases. People with certain lung diseases, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, may have an increased risk of lung cancer.

Lung cancer can cause complications, such as:

    * Shortness of breath. People with lung cancer can experience shortness of breath if cancer grows to block the major airways. Lung cancer can also cause fluid to accumulate around the lungs, making it harder for the lungs to expand fully when you inhale.
    * Coughing up blood. Lung cancer can cause bleeding in the airway, which can cause you to cough up blood (hemoptysis). Sometimes bleeding can become severe. Treatments are available to control bleeding.
    * Pain. Advanced lung cancer that spreads to the lining of the lung or to another area of the body can cause pain. Tell your doctor if you experience pain. Pain may initially be mild and intermittent, but can become constant. Medications, radiation therapy and other treatments may help make you more comfortable.
    * Fluid in the chest (pleural effusion). Lung cancer can cause fluid to accumulate in the space that surrounds the lungs in the chest cavity (pleural space). Pleural effusion can result from cancer spreading outside the lungs or in reaction to lung cancer inside the lungs. Fluid accumulating in the chest can cause shortness of breath. Treatments are available to drain the fluid from your chest and reduce the risk that pleural effusion will occur again.
    * Cancer that spreads to other parts of the body (metastasis). Lung cancer often spreads (metastasizes) to other parts of the body — most commonly the opposite lung, brain, bones, liver and adrenal glands. Cancer that spreads can cause pain, nausea, headaches or other signs and symptoms depending on what organ is affected. In some cases, treatments are available for isolated metastasis, but in most cases, the goal of treatment for metastasis is only to relieve signs and symptoms.
    * Death. Unfortunately, survival rates for people diagnosed with lung cancer are very low. In most cases, the disease is fatal. People diagnosed at the earliest stages have the greatest chances for a cure. Your doctor can discuss your chances for survival with you.

Lung Cancer Overview

Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer deaths in both women and men in the United States and throughout the world. Lung cancer has surpassed breast cancer as the leading cause of cancer deaths in women. In the United States in 2007, 160,390 people were projected to die from lung cancer, which is more than the number of deaths from colorectal, breast, and prostate cancer combined. Only about 2% of those diagnosed with lung cancer that has spread to other areas of the body are alive five years after the diagnosis, although the survival rates for lung cancers diagnosed at a very early stage are higher, with approximately 49% surviving for five years or longer.

Cancer occurs when normal cells undergo a transformation that causes them to grow and multiply without the normal controls. The cells form a mass or tumor that differs from the surrounding tissues from which it arises. Tumors are dangerous because they take oxygen, nutrients, and space from healthy cells.

Most lung tumors are malignant. This means that they invade and destroy the healthy tissues around them and can spread throughout the body.

    * The tumors can also spread to nearby lymph nodes or through the bloodstream to other organs. This process is called metastasis.

    * When lung cancer metastasizes, the tumor in the lung is called the primary tumor, and the tumors in other parts of the body are called secondary tumors or metastatic tumors.

Some lung tumors are metastatic from cancers elsewhere in the body. The lungs are a common site for metastasis. If this is the case, the cancer is not considered to be lung cancer. For example, if prostate cancer spreads via the bloodstream to the lungs, it is metastatic prostate cancer (a secondary cancer) in the lung and is not called lung cancer.

Lung cancers are usually divided into two main groups that account for about 95% of all cases.

    * The division into groups is based on the type of cells that make up the cancer.

    * The two main types of lung cancer are characterized by the cell size of the tumor when viewed under the microscope. They are called small cell lung cancer (SCLC) and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). NSCLC includes several subtypes of tumors.

    * SCLCs are less common, but they grow more quickly and are more likely to metastasize than NSCLCs. Often, SCLCs have already spread to other parts of the body when the cancer is diagnosed.

    * About 5% of lung cancers are of rare cell types, including carcinoid tumor, lymphoma, and others.

The specific types of primary lung cancers are as follows:

    * Adenocarcinoma (an NSCLC) is the most common type of lung cancer, making up 30%-40% of all cases. A subtype of adenocarcinoma is called bronchoalveolar cell carcinoma, which creates a pneumonia-like appearance on chest x-rays.

    * Squamous cell carcinoma (an NSCLC) is the second most common type of lung cancer, making up about 30% of all lung cancers.

    * Large cell cancer (another NSCLC) makes up 10% of all cases.

    * SCLC makes up 20% of all cases.

Lung Cancer Causes

Cigarette smoking is the most important cause of lung cancer. Research as far back as the 1950s clearly established this relationship.

    * Cigarette smoke contains more than 4,000 chemicals, many of which have been identified as causing cancer.

    * A person who smokes more than one pack of cigarettes per day has a risk of developing lung cancer 20-25 times greater than someone who has never smoked.

    * Once a person quits smoking, his or her risk for lung cancer gradually decreases. About 15 years after quitting, the risk for lung cancer decreases to the level of someone who never smoked.

    * Cigar and pipe smoking increases the risk of lung cancer but not as much as smoking cigarettes.

About 90% of lung cancers arise due to tobacco use. The risk of developing lung cancer is related to the following factors:

    * the number of cigarettes smoked,

    * the age at which a person started smoking, and

    * how long a person has smoked (or had smoked before quitting).

Other causes of lung cancer include the following:

    * Passive smoking, or secondhand smoke, presents another risk for lung cancer. An estimated 3,000 lung cancer deaths occur each year in the U.S. that are attributable to passive smoking.

    * Air pollution from motor vehicles, factories, and other sources probably increase the risk for lung cancer, and many experts believe that prolonged exposure to polluted air is similar to prolonged exposure to passive smoking in terms of risk for developing lung cancer.

    * Asbestos exposure increases the risk of lung cancer by nine times. A combination of asbestos exposure and cigarette smoking raises the risk to as much as 50 times. Another cancer known as mesothelioma (a type of cancer of the pleura or of the lining of the abdominal cavity called the peritoneum) is also strongly associated with exposure to asbestos.

    * Lung diseases, such as tuberculosis (TB) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), also create a risk for lung cancer. A person with COPD has a four to six times greater risk of lung cancer even when the effect of cigarette smoking is excluded.

    * Radon exposure poses another risk.

          o Radon is a by-product of naturally occurring radium, which is a product of uranium.

          o Radon is present in indoor and outdoor air.

          o The risk for lung cancer increases with significant long-term exposure to radon, although no one knows the exact risk. An estimated 12% of lung cancer deaths are attributable to radon gas, or 15,000 to 22,000 lung cancer-related deaths annually in the U.S. Radon gas is the second leading cause of lung cancer in the U.S. As with asbestos exposure, smoking greatly increases the risk of lung cancer with radon exposure.

    * Certain occupations where exposure to arsenic, chromium, nickel, aromatic hydrocarbons, and ethers occurs may increase the risk of lung cancer.

    * A person who has had lung cancer is more likely to develop a second lung cancer than the average person is to develop a first lung cancer.

Lung Cancer Symptoms

Up to one-fourth of all people with lung cancer may have no symptoms when the cancer is diagnosed. These cancers usually are identified incidentally when a chest x-ray is performed for another reason. The majority of people, however, develop symptoms. The symptoms are due to direct effects of the primary tumor, to effects of metastatic tumors in other parts of the body, or to disturbances of hormones, blood, or other systems caused by the cancer.

Symptoms of primary lung cancers include cough, coughing up blood, chest pain, and shortness of breath.

    * A new cough in a smoker or a former smoker should raise concern for lung cancer.

    * A cough that does not go away or gets worse over time should be evaluated by a health-care provider.

    * Coughing up blood (hemoptysis) occurs in a significant number of people who have lung cancer. Any amount of coughed-up blood is cause for concern.

    * Chest pain is a symptom in about one-fourth of people with lung cancer. The pain is dull, aching, and persistent and may involve other structures surrounding the lung.

    * Shortness of breath usually results from a blockage to the flow of air in part of the lung, collection of fluid around the lung (pleural effusion), or the spread of tumor throughout the lungs.

    * Wheezing or hoarseness may signal blockage or inflammation in the lungs that may go along with cancer.

    * Repeated respiratory infections, such as bronchitis or pneumonia, can be a sign of lung cancer.

Symptoms of metastatic lung tumors depend on the location and size. About 30%-40% of people with lung cancer have some symptoms or signs of metastatic disease.

    * Lung cancer most often spreads to the liver, the adrenal glands, the bones, and the brain.

    * Metastatic lung cancer in the liver usually does not cause symptoms, at least by the time of diagnosis.

    * Metastatic lung cancer in the adrenal glands also typically causes no symptoms by the time of diagnosis.

    * Metastasis to the bones is most common with small cell cancers but also occurs with other lung cancer types. Lung cancer that has metastasized to the bone causes bone pain, usually in the backbone (vertebrae), the thighbones, and the ribs.

    * Lung cancer that spreads to the brain can cause difficulties with vision, weakness on one side of the body, and/or seizures.

Paraneoplastic syndromes are the remote, indirect effects of cancer not related to direct invasion of an organ by tumor cells. Often they are caused by chemicals released from the cancers. Symptoms include the following:

    * clubbing of fingers-the depositing of extra tissue under the fingernails

    * new bone formation-along the lower legs or arms

    * anemia-low numbers of red blood cells and high calcium level or low sodium level in the blood

    * other effects-muscle weakness, skin rashes, and degeneration of the brain

    * weight loss

    * fatigue

    * low sodium levels

When to Seek Medical Care

See a health-care provider as soon as possible if any of the following develop:

    * any symptom of lung cancer,

    * new cough or change in an existing cough,

    * hemoptysis (flecks of blood in the sputum when coughing),

    * unexplained weight loss,

    * unexplained persistent fatigue, or

    * unexplained deep aches or pains.

Go immediately to the nearest hospital emergency department if any of the following occur:

    * coughing up a large amount of blood,

    * sudden shortness of breath,

    * sudden weakness,

    * sudden vision problems, or

    * persistent chest pain.

Exams and Tests

Upon hearing about the symptoms, a health-care provider will formulate a list of possible diagnoses. He or she will ask questions about the symptoms, medical and surgical history, smoking and work history, and other questions about lifestyle, overall health, and medications.

Unless severe hemoptysis is occurring, a chest x-ray will most likely be performed first to look for a cause of the respiratory symptoms.

    * The x-ray film may or may not show an abnormality.

    * Types of abnormalities seen in lung cancer include a small nodule or nodules or a large mass.

    * Not all abnormalities observed on a chest x-ray are cancers. For example, some people develop scarring and calcium deposits in their lungs that may look like tumors on a chest x-ray film.

In most cases, a CT scan or MRI of the chest will further define the problem.

    * If symptoms are severe, the x-ray may be skipped and a CT scan or MRI may be performed right away.

    * The advantages of CT scan and MRI are that they show much greater detail than x-rays and are able to show the lungs in three dimensions.

    * These tests help determine the stage of the cancer by showing the size of the tumor or tumors.

    * They can also help identify spread of the cancer into nearby lymph nodes or certain other organs.

If a person's chest x-ray film or scan suggests that a tumor is present, he or she will undergo a procedure for diagnosis.

    * This procedure involves collection of sputum, removal of a small piece of the tumor tissue (biopsy) or a small volume of fluid from the sac around the lung.

    * The retrieved cells are reviewed under a microscope by a doctor who specializes in diagnosing diseases by looking at cell and tissue types (a pathologist).

    * Several different ways exist to obtain these cells.

Sputum testing: This is a simple test that is sometimes performed to detect cancer in the lungs.

    * Sputum is thick mucus that may be produced during a cough.

    * Cells in the sputum can be examined to see if they are cancerous. This is called cytologic review.

    * This is not a completely reliable test. If negative, the findings usually need to be confirmed by further testing.

Bronchoscopy: This is an endoscopic test, meaning that a thin, flexible, lighted tube with a tiny camera on the end is used to view organs inside the body.

    * Bronchoscopy is endoscopy of the lungs. The bronchoscope is inserted through the mouth or nose and down the windpipe. From there, the tube can be inserted into the airways (bronchi) of the lungs.

    * A tiny camera transmits images back to a video monitor.

    * The physician operating the bronchoscope can look for tumors and collect samples of any suspected tumors.

    * Bronchoscopy can usually be used to determine the extent of the tumor.

    * The procedure is uncomfortable. A local anesthetic is administered to the mouth and throat as well as sedation to make bronchoscopy tolerable.

    * Bronchoscopy has some risks and requires a specialist proficient in performing the procedure.

Needle biopsy: If a tumor is on the periphery of the lung, it usually cannot be seen with bronchoscopy. Instead, a biopsy is taken through a needle inserted through the chest wall and into the tumor.

    * Typically, a chest x-ray or CT scanning is used to guide the needle.

    * This procedure is safe and effective in obtaining sufficient tissue for diagnosis. After the chest surface is cleaned and prepared, the skin and the chest wall are numbed.

    * The most serious risk with this procedure is that the needle puncture may cause an air leak from the lung (pneumothorax). This air leak occurs in as many as 3%-5% of cases. Although this condition can be dangerous, it is almost always recognized and treated without serious consequences.

Thoracentesis: Lung cancers, both primary and metastatic, can cause fluid to collect in the sac surrounding the lung. This fluid is called a pleural effusion.

    * The fluid usually contains cells from the cancer.

    * Sampling this fluid can confirm the presence of cancer in the lungs.

    * The fluid sample is removed by a needle in a procedure similar to needle biopsy.

    * Thoracentesis can be important for both staging and diagnosis of the condition.

Thoracotomy: Sometimes a lung cancer tumor cannot be reached by bronchoscopy or needle procedures.

    * In these cases, the only way to obtain a biopsy is by performing an operation.

    * The chest is opened (thoracotomy), and as much of the tumor as possible is removed surgically. The removed tumor is then examined microscopically.

    * Unfortunately, this operation may not be successful in removing all tumor cells if the tumor is large or has spread to the lymph nodes outside of the lungs.

    * Thoracotomy is a major operation that is performed in a hospital.

Mediastinoscopy: This is another endoscopic procedure. It is performed to determine the extent that the cancer has spread into the area of the chest between the lungs (the mediastinum).

    * A small incision is made into the lower part of the neck, above the breastbone (sternum). A variation is to make the incision in the chest.

    * A mediastinoscope is inserted behind the breastbone.

    * Samples of the lymph nodes are taken to evaluate for cancer cells.

    * Mediastinoscopy is a very important step to determine whether the tumor can be surgically removed or not.

Other tests: Other tests are performed to stage the tumor and to assess a person's ability to withstand surgery and other treatment.

    * Pulmonary function tests assess breathing capacity.

    * Blood tests are performed to identify any chemical imbalances, blood disorders, or other problems that might complicate treatment.

    * CT scans or MRIs may be performed on the most common areas of spread to check for metastatic disease. These tests are generally performed only if symptoms occur that suggest metastatic disease. Certain treatment protocols require that these tests be performed.

    * A bone scan can determine whether the cancer has spread to the bones.

Staging: Staging is a method of classifying the tumor for purposes of treatment planning.

    * Staging is based on size of the tumor, location of the tumor, and degree of metastasis of the tumor (if any).

    * The treatment will be individually tailored to the tumor stage.

    * Tumor stage is related to the outlook for cure and survival (prognosis). The higher the tumor stage, the less likely the disease will be cured.

Lung Cancer Treatment

Treatment decisions in lung cancer depend on whether SCLC or NSCLC is present. Treatment also depends on tumor stage, particularly in NSCLC. A person's general physical condition (the ability to withstand treatment procedures) is also taken into account.

The most widely used therapies for lung cancer are surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation therapy.


Medical Treatment

Chemotherapy and radiation therapy

    * Chemotherapy and radiation may lead to a cure in a small number of patients. These therapies result in shrinking of the tumor and are known to prolong life for extended periods in most patients.

    * Chemotherapy and radiation are very effective at relieving symptoms.

    * Inoperable NSCLCs are treated with chemotherapy or a combination of chemotherapy and radiation.

    * If SCLC is in an early stage (confined to the thorax), the standard of care is chemotherapy and radiation therapy given at the same time.

    * In later stages (spread outside of the thorax), SCLC is treated with chemotherapy and palliative radiation therapy to areas where metastases may be present.

    * The brain is sometimes treated with radiation even if no tumor is present there. Called prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI), this therapy may prevent a tumor from forming. PCI is not suitable for all patients, however, and side effects may occur.

    * Limited SCLC (has not spread outside the chest cavity) has an 80%-90% rate of response to combination chemotherapy and radiation therapy. Remission (no cancer detected by physical examination or x-ray studies) occurs in 50%-60% of cases.

    * Of all cases of advanced-stage lung cancer (spread outside the chest cavity), approximately 50%-60% of SCLC and 15%-40% of NSCLC will go in to remission with chemotherapy.

    * If relapse occurs, a different type of chemotherapy regimen may offer symptom relief and modest survival benefit.

    * Even with an initially favorable response to treatment, SCLC tends to relapse within one to two years in most patients, particularly in those with extensive disease.

    * Recent research has shown benefits of adjuvant chemotherapy in early stage NSCLC in preventing or delaying recurrence of the tumor, even after surgery that is felt to be successful at removing cancer.

    * Chemotherapy uses chemicals that travel through the bloodstream. It affects both cancerous and healthy cells. This accounts for the many well-known side effects of chemotherapy, including nausea and vomiting, hair loss, skin problems, mouth sores, and fatigue.

    * Radiation therapy does not affect cells throughout the body the way chemotherapy does. However, it does affect healthy tissues overlying or directly adjacent to the tumor. To a certain extent, the side effects of radiation depend on which part of the body is targeted with radiation.

    * Based on recent clinical trial data, chemotherapy has been found to be beneficial for all stages of non-small cell lung cancer, including stage I or II. People with lung cancer should be referred to an oncologist for discussion of options.

Surgery

Surgery is the preferred treatment for patients with early stage NSCLC. Unfortunately, 60%-80% of all patients who have advanced or metastatic disease are not suitable for surgery.

    * People who have NSCLC that has not spread can tolerate surgery provided they have adequate lung function.

    * A portion of a lobe, a full lobe, or an entire lung may be removed. The extent of removal depends on the size of the tumor, its location, and how far it has spread.

    * A technique called cryosurgery is sometimes used for NSCLC. In cryosurgery, the tumor is killed by freezing it. This treatment is mainly for relief of symptoms.

    * Cure rates for small peripheral cancers are around 80%.

    * Despite complete surgical removal, a large proportion of patients with early stage cancer have recurrence of cancer and die from it.

Surgery is not widely used in SCLC. Because SCLC spreads widely and rapidly through the body, removing it all by surgery usually is impossible.

An operation for lung cancer is major surgery. Many people experience pain, weakness, fatigue, and shortness of breath after surgery. Most have problems moving around, coughing, and breathing deeply. The recovery period can be several weeks or even months.

Next Steps

Follow-up

Following surgery for any operable lung cancer, there is an increased risk of developing a second primary lung cancer is present as well as risk that the original tumor will come back.

    * Many lung cancers come back within the first two years after treatment.

    * Regular testing should be performed so that any recurrence can be identified as early as possible.

    * A person who has undergone surgery should receive follow-up care and examinations according to recommendations from the treatment team.

Palliative and terminal care

Palliative care or hospice care refers to medical or nursing care to reduce symptoms and suffering without attempting to cure the underlying disease. Because only a small number of people with lung cancer are cured, relief from suffering becomes the primary goal for many.

    * The patient, his or her family, and the doctor will probably recognize when the patient has reached this point.

    * Whenever possible, the transition to palliative care should be planned in advance.

    * Planning should begin with a three-way conversation between the patient, someone representing the patient (if he or she is too ill to participate), and the health-care provider.

    * During these meetings, likely outcomes, medical issues, and any fears or uncertainties can be discussed.

Palliative care may be given at home, in a hospital if home care is not possible, or in a hospice facility. Palliative care consists mainly of treatments to relieve shortness of breath and pain.

    * Breathlessness will be treated with oxygen and medications such as opioids, which are narcotic drugs such as opium, morphine, codeine, methadone, and heroin.

    * Pain management includes anti-inflammatory medications and opioids. The patient is encouraged to participate in determining doses of the pain medication, because how much is needed to block pain will vary from day to day.

    * Other symptoms, such as anxiety, lack of sleep, and depression, are treated with appropriate medications and, in some cases, complementary therapies.

Prevention

Lung cancer remains a highly preventable disease because 90% of lung cancers occur in smokers or former smokers. The best way to prevent lung cancer is to not smoke.

    * Cigarette smoking is highly addictive, and quitting often proves to be difficult. However, smoking rates have recently decreased in North America and in other parts of the world.

    * Health-care workers play an important role in identifying smokers and helping them quit.

    * Many products such as nicotine gum, nicotine sprays, nicotine inhalers, and other types of medications have been successfully used to help people trying to quit smoking.

    * Minimizing exposure to passive smoking is also an effective preventive measure.

    * Using a home radon test kit can identify and allow correction of increased radon levels in the home, which can also cause lung cancers.

    * Smokers who use a combination of supplemental nicotine, group therapy, and behavioral training show a significant drop in smoking rates.

Screening for lung cancer consists of the following:

    * Currently, the American Cancer Society does not recommend routine chest x-ray screening for lung cancer. What this means is that many health-insurance plans do not cover screening chest x-rays or CT scans.

    * Periodic chest x-rays may be appropriate for current or former smokers. Discuss the pros and cons of this approach with a health-care provider.

    * Low-dose CT scans have shown great potential in detecting early stage lung cancer and therefore surgical cure. This procedure requires a special type of CT scanner (spiral CT) and has been shown to be an effective tool for the identification of small lung cancers in smokers and former smokers. However, it has not yet been proven whether the use of this technique actually saves lives or lowers the risk of death from lung cancer. Trials are underway to further determine the utility of spiral CT scans in screening for lung cancer.
Outlook

Overall (including all types and stages of lung cancer), 16% of people with lung cancer survive for at least five years. Survival rates tend to be low when compared to the 65% five-year survival rate for colon cancer, 89% for breast cancer, and over 99% for prostate cancer.

    * People who have stage I NSCLC and undergo lung surgery have a 60%-70% chance of surviving five years.

    * People with stage II NSCLC have a 30%-40% chance of cure, and those with stage IIIa have a 20%-30% chance of cure.

    * People with extensive nonoperable lung cancer have an average survival duration of nine months or less.

    * Those with limited SCLC who receive chemotherapy have a two-year survival rate of 20%-30% and a five-year survival rate of 10%-15%.

    * Less than 5% of people with extensive-stage SCLC (small cell cancers) are alive after two years, with a median survival range of eight to 13 months.

Support Groups and Counseling

Living with cancer presents many new challenges for people with cancer and for their family and friends.

    * People with cancer will probably have many worries about how the cancer will affect them and their ability to live a normal life, that is, to care for their family and home, to hold a job, and to continue the friendships and activities they enjoy.

    * Many people feel anxious and depressed. Some people feel angry and resentful; others feel helpless and defeated.

For most people with cancer, talking about their feelings and concerns helps.

    * Friends and family members can be very supportive. They may be hesitant to offer support until they see how the person with cancer is coping. People with cancer should not wait for friends or family to bring it up; if they want to talk about their concerns, they should let friends and family know.

    * Some people do not want to burden their loved ones or just prefer talking about their concerns with a more neutral professional. Discussing feelings and concerns about having cancer with a social worker, counselor, or member of the clergy can be helpful. A surgeon or oncologist should be able to recommend someone.

    * Many people with cancer are profoundly helped by talking to other people who have cancer. Sharing concerns with others who have been through the same thing can be remarkably reassuring. Support groups of people with cancer may be available through the medical center where treatment is being received. The American Cancer Society also has information about support groups all over the United States.

    *   Secondhand smoke (also called environmental tobacco smoke) is the combination of smoke given off by the burning end of a tobacco product and the smoke exhaled by the smoker (see Question 1).
    * Of the chemicals identified in secondhand smoke, more than 50 have been found to cause cancer (see Question 3).
    * Secondhand smoke causes lung cancer in nonsmokers (see Question 4).
    * Secondhand smoke causes heart disease in adults and sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS), ear infections, and asthma attacks in children (see Question 5).
    * There is no safe level of exposure to secondhand smoke (see Question 6).

   1. What is secondhand smoke?

      Secondhand smoke (also called environmental tobacco smoke) is the combination of sidestream smoke (the smoke given off by the burning end of a tobacco product) and mainstream smoke (the smoke exhaled by the smoker) (1, 2, 3, 4). Exposure to secondhand smoke is also called involuntary smoking or passive smoking. People are exposed to secondhand smoke in homes, cars, the workplace, and public places such as bars, restaurants, and other recreation settings. In the United States, the source of most secondhand smoke is from cigarettes, followed by pipes, cigars, and other tobacco products (4).
   2. How is secondhand smoke exposure measured?

      Secondhand smoke is measured by testing indoor air for nicotine or other smoke constituents. Exposure to secondhand smoke can be tested by measuring the levels of cotinine (a nicotine by-product in the body) in the nonsmoker’s blood, saliva, or urine (1). Nicotine, cotinine, carbon monoxide, and other evidence of secondhand smoke exposure have been found in the body fluids of nonsmokers exposed to secondhand smoke.
   3. Does secondhand smoke contain harmful chemicals?

      Yes. Of the more than 4,000 chemicals that have been identified in secondhand tobacco smoke, at least 250 are known to be harmful, and 50 of these are known to cause cancer. These chemicals include (1):
          * arsenic (a heavy metal toxin)
          * benzene (a chemical found in gasoline)
          * beryllium (a toxic metal)
          * cadmium (a metal used in batteries)
          * chromium (a metallic element)
          * ethylene oxide (a chemical used to sterilize medical devices)
          * nickel (a metallic element)
          * polonium–210 (a chemical element that gives off radiation)
          * vinyl chloride (a toxic substance used in plastics manufacture)

      Many factors affect which chemicals are found in secondhand smoke, including the type of tobacco, the chemicals added to the tobacco, the way the product is smoked, and the paper in which the tobacco is wrapped (1, 3, 4).
   4. Does exposure to secondhand smoke cause cancer?

      Yes. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the U.S. National Toxicology Program (NTP), the U.S. Surgeon General, and the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) have classified secondhand smoke as a known human carcinogen (cancer-causing agent) (1, 3, 5).

      Inhaling secondhand smoke causes lung cancer in nonsmoking adults (4). Approximately 3,000 lung cancer deaths occur each year among adult nonsmokers in the United States as a result of exposure to secondhand smoke (2). The Surgeon General estimates that living with a smoker increases a nonsmoker’s chances of developing lung cancer by 20 to 30 percent (4).

      Some research suggests that secondhand smoke may increase the risk of breast cancer, nasal sinus cavity cancer, and nasopharyngeal cancer in adults, and leukemia, lymphoma, and brain tumors in children (4). Additional research is needed to learn whether a link exists between secondhand smoke exposure and these cancers.
   5. What are the other health effects of exposure to secondhand smoke?

      Secondhand smoke causes disease and premature death in nonsmoking adults and children (4). Exposure to secondhand smoke irritates the airways and has immediate harmful effects on a person’s heart and blood vessels. It may increase the risk of heart disease by an estimated 25 to 30 percent (4). In the United States, secondhand smoke is thought to cause about 46,000 heart disease deaths each year (6). There may also be a link between exposure to secondhand smoke and the risk of stroke and hardening of the arteries; however, additional research is needed to confirm this link.

      Children exposed to secondhand smoke are at an increased risk of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS), ear infections, colds, pneumonia, bronchitis, and more severe asthma. Being exposed to secondhand smoke slows the growth of children’s lungs and can cause them to cough, wheeze, and feel breathless (4).
   6. What is a safe level of secondhand smoke?

      There is no safe level of exposure to secondhand smoke. Studies have shown that even low levels of secondhand smoke exposure can be harmful. The only way to fully protect nonsmokers from secondhand smoke exposure is to completely eliminate smoking in indoor spaces. Separating smokers from nonsmokers, cleaning the air, and ventilating buildings cannot completely eliminate secondhand smoke exposure (4).
   7. What is being done to reduce nonsmokers’ exposure to secondhand smoke?

      Many state and local governments have passed laws prohibiting smoking in public facilities such as schools, hospitals, airports, and bus terminals. Increasingly, state and local governments are also requiring private workplaces, including restaurants and bars, to be smoke free. To highlight the significant risk from secondhand smoke exposure, the National Cancer Institute, a component of the National Institutes of Health, holds meetings and conferences in states, counties, cities, or towns that are smoke free, unless certain circumstances justify an exception to this policy.

      More information about state-level tobacco regulations is available through the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) State Tobacco Activities Tracking and Evaluation (STATE) System Web site. The STATE System is a database containing up-to-date and historical state-level data on tobacco use prevention and control. This resource is available at http://apps.nccd.cdc.gov/statesystem/ on the Internet.

      On the national level, several laws restricting smoking in public places have been passed. Federal law bans smoking on domestic airline flights, nearly all flights between the United States and foreign destinations, interstate buses, and most trains. Smoking is also banned in most Federally owned buildings. The Pro-Children Act of 1994 prohibits smoking in facilities that routinely provide Federally funded services to children.

      The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) Healthy People 2010, a comprehensive, nationwide health promotion and disease prevention agenda, includes the goal of reducing the proportion of nonsmokers exposed to secondhand smoke from 65 percent to 45 percent by 2010 (7). More information about this program is available on the Healthy People 2010 Web site at http://www.healthypeople.gov/ on the Internet.

      Internationally, several nations, including France, Ireland, New Zealand, Norway, and Uruguay, require all workplaces, including bars and restaurants, to be smoke free.

Asbestos Exposure and Cancer Risk
Key Points

    * Asbestos is the name given to a group of minerals that occur naturally in the environment as bundles of fibers (see Question 1).
    * Exposure to asbestos may increase the risk of asbestosis, other nonmalignant lung and pleural disorders, lung cancer, mesothelioma, and other cancers (see Question 3).
    * Smokers who are also exposed to asbestos have a greatly increased risk of lung cancer (see Question 6).
    * Individuals who have been exposed (or suspect they have been exposed) to asbestos on the job, through the environment, or at home through a family contact should inform their physician and report any symptoms (see Question 7).
    * Government agencies can provide additional information on asbestos exposure (see Questions 8, 9, and 11).

   1. What is asbestos?

      Asbestos is the name given to a group of minerals that occur naturally in the environment as bundles of fibers that can be separated into thin, durable threads. These fibers are resistant to heat, fire, and chemicals and do not conduct electricity. For these reasons, asbestos has been used widely in many industries.

      Chemically, asbestos minerals are silicate compounds, meaning they contain atoms of silicon and oxygen in their molecular structure.

      Asbestos minerals are divided into two major groups: Serpentine asbestos and amphibole asbestos. Serpentine asbestos includes the mineral chrysotile, which has long, curly fibers that can be woven. Chrysotile asbestos is the form that has been used most widely in commercial applications. Amphibole asbestos includes the minerals actinolite, tremolite, anthophyllite, crocidolite, and amosite. Amphibole asbestos has straight, needle-like fibers that are more brittle than those of serpentine asbestos and are more limited in their ability to be fabricated (1, 2).
   2. How is asbestos used?

      Asbestos has been mined and used commercially in North America since the late 1800s. Its use increased greatly during World War II (3, 4). Since then, asbestos has been used in many industries. For example, the building and construction industries have used it for strengthening cement and plastics as well as for insulation, roofing, fireproofing, and sound absorption. The shipbuilding industry has used asbestos to insulate boilers, steam pipes, and hot water pipes. The automotive industry uses asbestos in vehicle brake shoes and clutch pads. Asbestos has also been used in ceiling and floor tiles; paints, coatings, and adhesives; and plastics. In addition, asbestos has been found in vermiculite-containing garden products and some talc-containing crayons.

      In the late 1970s, the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) banned the use of asbestos in wallboard patching compounds and gas fireplaces because the asbestos fibers in these products could be released into the environment during use. In addition, manufacturers of electric hairdryers voluntarily stopped using asbestos in their products in 1979. In 1989, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) banned all new uses of asbestos; however, uses developed before 1989 are still allowed. The EPA also established regulations that require school systems to inspect buildings for the presence of damaged asbestos and to eliminate or reduce asbestos exposure to occupants by removing the asbestos or encasing it (2).

      In June 2000, the CPSC concluded that the risk of children’s exposure to asbestos fibers in crayons was extremely low (1). However, U.S. manufacturers of these crayons agreed to eliminate talc from their products.

      In August 2000, the EPA conducted a series of tests to evaluate the risk for consumers of adverse health effects associated with exposure to asbestos-contaminated vermiculite. The EPA concluded that exposure to asbestos from some vermiculite products poses only a minimal health risk. The EPA recommended that consumers reduce the low risk associated with the occasional use of vermiculite during gardening activities by limiting the amount of dust produced during vermiculite use. Specifically, the EPA suggested that consumers use vermiculite outdoors or in a well-ventilated area; keep vermiculite damp while using it; avoid bringing dust from vermiculite into the home on clothing; and use premixed potting soil, which is less likely to generate dust (2).

      The regulations described above and other actions, coupled with widespread public concern about the health hazards of asbestos, have resulted in a significant annual decline in the U.S. use of asbestos. Domestic consumption of asbestos amounted to about 803,000 metric tons in 1973, but it had dropped to about 2,400 metric tons by 2005 (3, 5).
   3. What are the health hazards of exposure to asbestos?

      People may be exposed to asbestos in their workplace, their communities, or their homes. If products containing asbestos are disturbed, tiny asbestos fibers are released into the air. When asbestos fibers are breathed in, they may get trapped in the lungs and remain there for a long time. Over time, these fibers can accumulate and cause scarring and inflammation, which can affect breathing and lead to serious health problems (6).

      Asbestos has been classified as a known human carcinogen (a substance that causes cancer) by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, the EPA, and the International Agency for Research on Cancer (2, 3, 7, 8). Studies have shown that exposure to asbestos may increase the risk of lung cancer and mesothelioma (a relatively rare cancer of the thin membranes that line the chest and abdomen). Although rare, mesothelioma is the most common form of cancer associated with asbestos exposure. In addition to lung cancer and mesothelioma, some studies have suggested an association between asbestos exposure and gastrointestinal and colorectal cancers, as well as an elevated risk for cancers of the throat, kidney, esophagus, and gallbladder (3, 4). However, the evidence is inconclusive.

      Asbestos exposure may also increase the risk of asbestosis (an inflammatory condition affecting the lungs that can cause shortness of breath, coughing, and permanent lung damage) and other nonmalignant lung and pleural disorders, including pleural plaques (changes in the membranes surrounding the lung), pleural thickening, and benign pleural effusions (abnormal collections of fluid between the thin layers of tissue lining the lungs and the wall of the chest cavity). Although pleural plaques are not precursors to lung cancer, evidence suggests that people with pleural disease caused by exposure to asbestos may be at increased risk for lung cancer (2, 9).
   4. Who is at risk for an asbestos-related disease?

      Everyone is exposed to asbestos at some time during their life. Low levels of asbestos are present in the air, water, and soil. However, most people do not become ill from their exposure. People who become ill from asbestos are usually those who are exposed to it on a regular basis, most often in a job where they work directly with the material or through substantial environmental contact.

      Since the early 1940s, millions of American workers have been exposed to asbestos. Health hazards from asbestos fibers have been recognized in workers exposed in the shipbuilding trades, asbestos mining and milling, manufacturing of asbestos textiles and other asbestos products, insulation work in the construction and building trades, and a variety of other trades. Demolition workers, drywall removers, asbestos removal workers, firefighters, and automobile workers also may be exposed to asbestos fibers. Studies evaluating the cancer risk experienced by automobile mechanics exposed to asbestos through brake repair are limited, but the overall evidence suggests there is no safe level of asbestos exposure (3, 8). As a result of Government regulations and improved work practices, today’s workers (those without previous exposure) are likely to face smaller risks than did those exposed in the past.

      Individuals involved in the rescue, recovery, and cleanup at the site of the September 11, 2001, attacks on the World Trade Center (WTC) in New York City are another group at risk of developing an asbestos-related disease. Because asbestos was used in the construction of the North Tower of the WTC, when the building was attacked, hundreds of tons of asbestos were released into the atmosphere. Those at greatest risk include firefighters, police officers, paramedics, construction workers, and volunteers who worked in the rubble at Ground Zero. Others at risk include residents in close proximity to the WTC towers and those who attended schools nearby. These individuals will need to be followed to determine the long-term health consequences of their exposure (10).

      One study found that nearly 70 percent of WTC rescue and recovery workers suffered new or worsened respiratory symptoms while performing work at the WTC site. The study describes the results of the WTC Worker and Volunteer Medical Screening Program, which was established to identify and characterize possible WTC-related health effects in responders. The study found that about 28 percent of those tested had abnormal lung function tests, and 61 percent of those without previous health problems developed respiratory symptoms (11). However, it is important to note that these symptoms may be related to exposure to debris components other than asbestos.

      Although it is clear that the health risks from asbestos exposure increase with heavier exposure and longer exposure time, investigators have found asbestos-related diseases in individuals with only brief exposures. Generally, those who develop asbestos-related diseases show no signs of illness for a long time after their first exposure. It can take from 10 to 40 years or more for symptoms of an asbestos-related condition to appear (2).

      There is some evidence that family members of workers heavily exposed to asbestos face an increased risk of developing mesothelioma (6). This risk is thought to result from exposure to asbestos fibers brought into the home on the shoes, clothing, skin, and hair of workers. To decrease these exposures, Federal law regulates workplace practices to limit the possibility of asbestos being brought home in this way. Some employees may be required to shower and change their clothes before they leave work, store their street clothes in a separate area of the workplace, or wash their work clothes at home separately from other clothes (2).

      Cases of mesothelioma have also been seen in individuals without occupational asbestos exposure who live close to asbestos mines (6).
   5. What factors affect the risk of developing an asbestos-related disease?

      Several factors can help to determine how asbestos exposure affects an individual, including (2, 6):

          * Dose (how much asbestos an individual was exposed to).
          * Duration (how long an individual was exposed).
          * Size, shape, and chemical makeup of the asbestos fibers.
          * Source of the exposure.
          * Individual risk factors, such as smoking and pre-existing lung disease.

      Although all forms of asbestos are considered hazardous, different types of asbestos fibers may be associated with different health risks. For example, the results of several studies suggest that amphibole forms of asbestos may be more harmful than chrysotile, particularly for mesothelioma risk, because they tend to stay in the lungs for a longer period of time (1, 2).

   6. How does smoking affect risk?

      Many studies have shown that the combination of smoking and asbestos exposure is particularly hazardous. Smokers who are also exposed to asbestos have a risk of developing lung cancer that is greater than the individual risks from asbestos and smoking added together (3, 6). There is evidence that quitting smoking will reduce the risk of lung cancer among asbestos-exposed workers (4). Smoking combined with asbestos exposure does not appear to increase the risk of mesothelioma (9). However, people who were exposed to asbestos on the job at any time during their life or who suspect they may have been exposed should not smoke.

   7. How are asbestos-related diseases detected?

      Individuals who have been exposed (or suspect they have been exposed) to asbestos fibers on the job, through the environment, or at home via a family contact should inform their doctor about their exposure history and whether or not they experience any symptoms. The symptoms of asbestos-related diseases may not become apparent for many decades after the exposure. It is particularly important to check with a doctor if any of the following symptoms develop (6):
          * Shortness of breath, wheezing, or hoarseness.
          * A persistent cough that gets worse over time.
          * Blood in the sputum (fluid) coughed up from the lungs.
          * Pain or tightening in the chest.
          * Difficulty swallowing.
          * Swelling of the neck or face.
          * Loss of appetite.
          * Weight loss.
          * Fatigue or anemia.

      A thorough physical examination, including a chest x-ray and lung function tests, may be recommended. The chest x-ray is currently the most common tool used to detect asbestos-related diseases. However, it is important to note that chest x-rays cannot detect asbestos fibers in the lungs, but they can help identify any early signs of lung disease resulting from asbestos exposure (2).

      Studies have shown that computed tomography (CT) (a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body taken from different angles; the pictures are created by a computer linked to an x-ray machine) may be more effective than conventional chest x-rays at detecting asbestos-related lung abnormalities in individuals who have been exposed to asbestos (12).

      A lung biopsy, which detects microscopic asbestos fibers in pieces of lung tissue removed by surgery, is the most reliable test to confirm the presence of asbestos-related abnormalities. A bronchoscopy is a less invasive test than a biopsy and detects asbestos fibers in material that is rinsed out of the lungs. It is important to note that these tests cannot determine how much asbestos an individual may have been exposed to or whether disease will develop (12). Asbestos fibers can also be detected in urine, mucus, or feces, but these tests are not reliable for determining how much asbestos may be in an individual’s lungs (2).
   8. How can workers protect themselves from asbestos exposure?

      The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) is a component of the U.S. Department of Labor (DOL) and is the Federal agency responsible for health and safety regulations in maritime, construction, manufacturing, and service workplaces. OSHA established regulations dealing with asbestos exposure on the job, specifically in construction work, shipyards, and general industry that employers are required to follow. In addition, the Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA), another component of the DOL, enforces regulations related to mine safety. Workers should use all protective equipment provided by their employers and follow recommended workplace practices and safety procedures. For example, National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH)-approved respirators that fit properly should be worn by workers when required.

      Workers who are concerned about asbestos exposure in the workplace should discuss the situation with other employees, their employee health and safety representative, and their employers. If necessary, OSHA can provide more information or make an inspection. Regional offices of OSHA are listed in the “United States Government” section of a telephone directory’s blue pages (under “Department of Labor”). Regional offices can also be found at http://www.osha.gov/html/RAmap.html on the Internet.

      More information about asbestos is available on the OSHA Asbestos Web page, which has links to information about asbestos in the workplace, including what OSHA standards apply, the hazards of asbestos, evaluating asbestos exposure, and controls used to protect workers.

   9. What programs are available to help individuals with asbestos-related diseases?

      Some people with asbestos-related illness may be eligible for Medicare coverage. Information about benefits is available from Medicare’s Regional Offices, located in 10 major cities across the United States and serving specific geographic areas. The Regional Offices serve as the agency’s initial point of contact for beneficiaries, health care providers, state and local governments, and the general public. Contact information for each Regional Office can be found at http://www.cms.hhs.gov/RegionalOffices on the Internet. General information about Medicare is available by calling toll-free 1–800–633–4227 (1–800–MEDICARE) or visiting http://www.medicare.gov on the Internet.

      People with occupational asbestos-related diseases also may qualify for financial help, including medical payments, under state workers’ compensation laws. Because eligibility requirements vary from state to state, workers employed by private companies or by state and local government agencies should contact their state workers’ compensation board. Contact information for state workers’ compensation officials may be found in the blue pages of a local telephone directory or at http://www.dol.gov/esa/regs/compliance/owcp/wc.htm on the Internet.

      If exposure occurred during employment with a Federal agency, medical expenses and other compensation may be covered by the Federal Employees’ Compensation Program, which is administered by the DOL, Employment Standards Administration’s Office of Workers’ Compensation Programs. This program provides workers’ compensation benefits to Federal (civilian) employees for employment-related injuries and diseases. Benefits include wage replacement, payment for medical care, and, where necessary, medical and vocational rehabilitation assistance in returning to work. Benefits may also be provided to dependents if the injury or disease causes the employee’s death. The program has 12 district offices nationwide.

      In addition, the Longshore and Harbor Workers’ Compensation Program provides benefits to longshoremen, harbor workers, other maritime workers, and other classes of private industry workers who are injured during the course of employment or suffer from diseases caused or worsened by conditions of employment. Information about eligibility and how to file a claim for benefits under either of these programs is available from:

      Eligible veterans may receive health care at a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Medical Center for an asbestos-related disease. Veterans can receive treatment for service-connected and nonservice-connected medical conditions. Information about eligibility and benefits is available from the VA Health Benefits Service Center at 1–877–222–8387 (1–877–222–VETS) or on the VA Web site at http://www1.va.gov/health/index.asp on the Internet.
  10. Is there Federal legislation to help victims of asbestos-related diseases?

      No Federal legislation has been enacted to compensate victims of asbestos-related diseases or to protect people from asbestos exposure. However, a bill called the Fairness in Asbestos Injury Resolution Act, or FAIR Act, has been introduced in Congress several times. This bill would create a national trust fund to compensate victims suffering from asbestos-related diseases. The proposed trust fund would be administered by the DOL, outside of the courts, through a claims process in which all individuals with certain medical symptoms and evidence of asbestos-related disease would be compensated. Funding for the trust would come from insurance companies and companies that mined, manufactured, and sold asbestos or asbestos products. Under the bill, individuals affected by asbestos exposure would no longer be able to pursue awards for damages in any Federal or state court.
  11. What other organizations offer information related to asbestos exposure?

      The organizations listed below can provide more information about asbestos exposure.

      The Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR) is the principal Federal agency responsible for evaluating the human health effects of exposure to hazardous substances. This agency works in close collaboration with local, state, and other Federal agencies, with tribal governments, and with communities and local health care providers to help prevent or reduce harmful human health effects from exposure to hazardous substances. The ATSDR provides information about asbestos and where to find occupational and environmental health clinics. The ATSDR can be contacted at:

      E-mail: 	cdcinfo@cdc.gov
      Internet Web site: 	http://www.atsdr.cdc.gov

      The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) regulates the general public’s exposure to asbestos in buildings, drinking water, and the environment. The EPA offers a Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) Hotline and an Asbestos Ombudsman. The TSCA Hotline provides technical assistance and information about asbestos programs implemented under the TSCA, which include the Asbestos School Hazard Abatement Act and the Asbestos Hazard Emergency Response Act. The Asbestos Ombudsman focuses on asbestos in schools and handles questions and complaints. Both the TSCA Hotline and the Asbestos Ombudsman can provide publications on a number of topics, particularly on controlling asbestos exposure in schools and other buildings. The Ombudsman operates a toll-free hotline for small businesses, trade associations, and others seeking free, confidential help.

      The EPA Web site includes a list of EPA regional and state asbestos contacts at http://www.epa.gov/asbestos/pubs/regioncontact.html on the Internet. In addition, EPA’s Asbestos and Vermiculite home page provides information about asbestos and its health effects and links to asbestos resources, including suggestions for homeowners who suspect asbestos in their homes, and laws and regulations applicable to asbestos.

Radon and Cancer: Questions and Answers

Key Points

    * Radon is a radioactive gas released from the normal decay of uranium in rocks and soil (see Question 1).
    * Radioactive particles from radon can damage cells that line the lungs and lead to lung cancer (see Question 3).
    * Radon is the second leading cause of lung cancer in the United States and is associated with 15,000 to 22,000 lung cancer deaths each year (see Question 4).
    * Studies showing a link between radon and lung cancer in humans include studies of underground uranium miners and of the general population exposed to radon in their homes (see Questions 5 and 6).
    * Testing is the only way to know if your home has elevated radon levels. Health authorities recommend radon testing and encourage corrective action when necessary (see Question 7).

   1. What is radon?

      Radon is a radioactive gas released from the normal decay of uranium in rocks and soil. It is an invisible, odorless, tasteless gas that seeps up through the ground and diffuses into the air. In a few areas, depending on local geology, radon dissolves into ground water and can be released into the air when the water is used. Radon gas usually exists at very low levels outdoors. However, in areas without adequate ventilation, such as underground mines, radon can accumulate to levels that substantially increase the risk of lung cancer.

   2. How is the general population exposed to radon?

      Radon is present in nearly all air. Everyone breathes radon in every day, usually at very low levels. However, people who inhale high levels of radon are at an increased risk for developing lung cancer.

      Radon can enter homes through cracks in floors, walls, or foundations, and collect indoors. It can also be released from building materials, or from water obtained from wells that contain radon. Radon levels can be higher in homes that are well insulated, tightly sealed, and/or built on uranium-rich soil. Because of their closeness to the ground, basement and first floors typically have the highest radon levels.

   3. How does radon cause cancer?

      Radon decays quickly, giving off tiny radioactive particles. When inhaled, these radioactive particles can damage the cells that line the lung. Long-term exposure to radon can lead to lung cancer, the only cancer proven to be associated with inhaling radon.

   4. How many people develop lung cancer because of exposure to radon?

      Cigarette smoking is the most common cause of lung cancer. Radon represents a far smaller risk for this disease, but it is the second leading cause of lung cancer in the United States. Scientists estimate that approximately 15,000 to 22,000 lung cancer deaths per year are related to radon.

      Although the association between radon exposure and smoking is not well understood, exposure to the combination of radon gas and cigarette smoke creates a greater risk for lung cancer than either factor alone. The majority of radon-related cancer deaths occur among smokers.

   5. How did scientists discover that radon plays a role in the development of lung cancer?

      Radon was identified as a health problem when scientists noted that underground uranium miners who were exposed to it died of lung cancer at high rates. Results of miner studies have been confirmed by experimental animal studies, which show higher rates of lung tumors among rodents exposed to high radon levels.

   6. What have scientists learned about the relationship between radon and lung cancer?

      Scientists agree that radon causes lung cancer in humans. Recent research has focused on specifying the effect of residential radon on lung cancer risk. In these studies, scientists measure radon levels in the homes of people who have lung cancer and compare them to the levels of radon in the homes of people who have not developed lung cancer.

      One of these studies, funded by the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, examined residential radon exposure in Iowa among females who had lived in their current home for at least 20 years. This study included 413 females with lung cancer and 614 females without lung cancer. During the study, radon levels were tested in homes, lung cancer tissues were examined, and the scientists collected information about home characteristics and other topics. Results from this study suggested a link between exposure to radon and lung cancer.

      Scientists have conducted more studies like this in other regions of the United States and around the world. Many of these studies have demonstrated an association between residential exposure to radon and lung cancer, but this finding has not been observed in all studies. The inconsistencies between studies are due in part to the small size of some studies, the varying levels of radon in many homes, and the difficulty of measuring a person’s exposure to radon over time.

      Researchers have combined and analyzed data from all radon studies conducted in Canada and the United States. By combining the data from these studies, scientists were able to analyze data from thousands of people. The results of this analysis demonstrated a slightly increased risk of lung cancer associated with exposure to household radon. This increased risk was consistent with the level of risk estimated based on studies of underground miners.

      Researchers are also investigating more precise ways to measure a person’s exposure to radon over time. In a study published in 2002, scientists examined radon exposure among people in Sweden who had not smoked daily for more than a year. This study included 110 people with lung cancer and 231 people without lung cancer. As with previous studies, the scientists measured radon levels of indoor air. The researchers also used a new technique of analyzing glass to estimate radon exposure over time. Using this technique, the scientists took measurements from glass in an object (e.g., a mirror or picture frame) that was at least 15 years old and had been in the person’s home throughout that time, even if the person had moved from one home to another. In this study, both of the techniques for measuring radon demonstrated a relationship between long-term exposure to radon and lung cancer, and supported the results of previous studies.

   7. How can people know if they have an elevated level of radon in their homes?

      Testing is the only way to know if a person’s home has elevated radon levels. Indoor radon levels are affected by the soil composition under and around the house, and the ease with which radon enters the house. Homes that are next door to each other can have different indoor radon levels, making a neighbor’s test result a poor predictor of radon risk. In addition, precipitation, barometric pressure, and other influences can cause radon levels to vary from month to month or day to day, which is why both short- and long-term tests are available.

      Short-term detectors measure radon levels for 2 days to 90 days, depending on the device. Long-term tests determine the average concentration for more than 90 days. Because radon levels can vary from day to day and month to month, a long-term test is a better indicator of average radon level. Both tests are relatively easy to use and inexpensive. A state or local radon official can explain the differences between testing devices and recommend the most appropriate test for a person’s needs and conditions.

      The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) recommends taking action to reduce radon in homes that have a radon level at or above 4 picocuries per liter (pCi/L). About one in 15 U.S. homes is estimated to have radon levels at or above this EPA action level. Scientists estimate that lung cancer deaths could be reduced by 2 to 4 percent, or about 5,000 deaths, by lowering radon levels in homes exceeding the EPA’s action level.

      The cost of a radon reduction depends on the size and design of a home and the radon reduction methods that are needed. These costs typically range from $800 to $2,500, with an average cost of $1,200.

 Lung Cancer

Also called: Bronchogenic carcinoma

Lung cancer is one of the most common cancers in the world. It is a leading cause of cancer death in men and women in the United States. Cigarette smoking causes most lung cancers. The more cigarettes you smoke per day and the earlier you started smoking, the greater your risk of lung cancer. High levels of pollution, radiation and asbestos exposure may also increase risk.

Common symptoms of lung cancer include

    * A cough that doesn't go away and gets worse over time
    * Constant chest pain
    * Coughing up blood
    * Shortness of breath, wheezing, or hoarseness
    * Repeated problems with pneumonia or bronchitis
    * Swelling of the neck and face
    * Loss of appetite or weight loss
    * Fatigue

There are many types of lung cancer. Each type of lung cancer grows and spreads in different ways and is treated differently. Treatment also depends on the stage, or how advanced it is. Treatment may include chemotherapy, radiation and surgery.

 Lung Cancer

This section has been reviewed and approved by the Cancer.Net Editorial Board, 12/08
Overview
Overview

Lung cancer affects more than 200,000 Americans each year. Although cigarette smoking is the main cause, anyone can develop lung cancer. Lung cancer is always treatable, no matter the size, location, or if the cancer has spread.

The lungs absorb oxygen from the air and bring the oxygen into the bloodstream for delivery to the rest of the body. As the body’s cells use oxygen, they release carbon dioxide. The bloodstream carries carbon dioxide back to the lungs, and the carbon dioxide leaves the body when people exhale. The lungs contain many different types of cells. Most cells in the lung are epithelial cells. Epithelial cells line the airways and produce mucus, which lubricates and protects the lung. The lung also contains nerve cells, hormone-producing cells, blood cells, and structural or supporting cells.

There are two major types of lung cancer: non-small cell and small cell. Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) arises from epithelial cells and is the most common type. Small cell lung cancer begins in the nerve cells or hormone-producing cells of the lung. The term “small cell” refers to the size and shape of the cancer cells as seen under a microscope. It is important for doctors to distinguish NSCLC from small cell lung cancer because the two types of cancer are usually treated in different ways.

Lung cancer begins when cells in the lung grow out of control and form a lump (also called a tumor, mass, lesion, or nodule). A tumor can be benign (noncancerous) or malignant (cancerous). A cancerous tumor is a collection of a large number of cancer cells that have the ability to spread to other parts of the body. A lung tumor can begin anywhere in the lung.

Once a cancerous lung tumor begins to grow, it may or may not shed cancer cells. These cells can be carried away in blood or float away in the natural fluid, called lymph, which surrounds lung tissue. Lymph flows through tubes called lymphatic vessels that drain into collecting stations called lymph nodes, the tiny, bean-shaped organs that help fight infection. Lymph nodes are located in the lungs, the center of the chest, and elsewhere in the body. The natural flow of lymph out of the lungs is toward the center of the chest, which explains why lung cancer often spreads there. When a cancer cell leaves its site of origin and moves into a lymph node or to a far away part of the body through the bloodstream, it is called metastasis.

The location and size of the initial lung tumor, and whether it has spread to lymph nodes or more distant sites, determines the stage of lung cancer. The type of lung cancer (NSCLC versus small cell) and stage of the disease (discussed later in Staging) determine what type of treatment is needed.

Statistics

In 2009, an estimated 219,440 adults (116,090 men and 103,350 women) in the United States will be diagnosed with lung cancer. Lung cancer is the second most common cancer and the leading cause of cancer deaths for men and women.  It is estimated that 159,390 deaths (88,900 men and 70,490 women) from this disease will occur this year. For all people with lung cancer, the one-year survival rate (percentage of people who survive at least one year after the cancer is detected excluding those who die from other diseases) is 41%. The five-year relative survival rate is 15%.

Lung cancer represents 15% of all cancer diagnoses and 28% of all cancer deaths. For men, death rates have declined consistently since 1994 at a rate of nearly 2% each year. The death rates for women with lung cancer have stabilized since 2003 after increasing for several decades. For unclear reasons, black men have the highest incidence and the lowest survival rates of lung cancer.

These statistics should not be taken as a death sentence. It is important to remember that statistics do not apply to an individual person. No doctor can tell a person how long he or she will live with lung cancer. Some people who are told that their lung cancer will be cured do not live as long as patients who are told that their lung cancer is not curable. The important thing to remember is that lung cancer is treatable at any stage, and that these treatments have been proven to help people live longer and better, despite a diagnosis of lung cancer.

Cancer survival statistics should be interpreted with caution. These estimates are based on data from thousands of cases of this type of cancer in the United States each year, but the actual risk for a particular individual may differ. Because survival statistics are often measured in multi-year intervals, they may not represent advances made in the treatment or diagnosis of this cancer.

Risk Factors and Prevention
Risk Factors and Prevention

A risk factor is anything that increases a person’s chance of developing cancer. Some risk factors can be controlled, such as smoking, and some cannot be controlled, such as age and family history. Although risk factors can influence the development of cancer, most do not directly cause cancer. Some people with several risk factors never develop cancer, while others with no known risk factors do. However, knowing your risk factors and communicating them to your doctor may help you make more informed lifestyle and health care choices.

The following factors may raise a person’s risk of developing lung cancer:

Tobacco. Most lung cancer occurs in people who smoke. Tobacco smoke damages cells in the lungs, causing the cells to grow abnormally. The risk that smoking will lead to cancer is higher for people who smoke heavily and/or for a long time. Regular exposure to smoke from someone else’s cigarettes, cigars, or pipes (called environmental or “secondhand” tobacco smoke) can increase a person’s risk of lung cancer even if that person does not smoke.

Asbestos. These are hair-like crystals found in many types of rock and are often used as fireproof insulation in buildings. When asbestos fibers are inhaled, they can irritate the lung. Many studies show that the combination of smoking and asbestos exposure is particularly hazardous. People who work with asbestos in jobs (such as shipbuilding, asbestos mining, insulation, or automotive brake repair) and smoke have a higher risk of developing lung cancer. Using protective breathing equipment reduces this risk.

Radon. This is an invisible, odorless gas naturally released by some soil and rocks. Exposure to radon has been associated with an increased risk of some types of cancer, including lung cancer. Most hardware stores have kits that test home radon levels, and basements can be ventilated to reduce radon exposure.

The most important way to prevent lung cancer is to avoid tobacco smoke. People who never smoke have the lowest risk of lung cancer. People who smoke can reduce their risk of lung cancer by stopping smoking, but their risk of lung cancer will still be higher than people who never smoked. Attempts to prevent lung cancer with vitamins or other treatments have not worked. Beta-carotene, a drug related to vitamin A, has been tested for the prevention of lung cancer. It did not reduce the risk of cancer. In people who continued to smoke, beta-carotene actually increased the risk of lung cancer.

Screening

There are no tests recommended for screening the general population for lung cancer. Doctors still need to prove that screening everyone at risk for lung cancer reduces rates of death from lung cancer in the general population. A new test, called a low-dose helical (or spiral) computed tomography (CT or CAT) scan, is currently being studied for this purpose. A CT scan creates a three-dimensional picture of the inside of the body with an x-ray machine. A computer then combines these images into a detailed, cross-sectional view that shows any abnormalities or tumors. Sometimes, a contrast medium (a special dye) is injected into a patient’s vein to provide better detail.
Symptoms

People with lung cancer may experience the following symptoms. Sometimes people with lung cancer do not show any of these symptoms. Or, these symptoms may be caused by a medical condition that is not cancer. If you are concerned about a symptom on this list, please talk with your doctor.

For people with lung cancer who have no symptoms, their lung cancer may be discovered on a chest x-ray or CT scan performed for some other reason, such as checking for heart disease. Most people with lung cancer are diagnosed when the tumor grows, takes up space, or begins to interfere with nearby structures. A lung tumor may also make fluid that can collect in the lung or the space around the lung. A tumor can push the air out of the lungs and cause the lung to collapse. In this way, a lung tumor can prevent the exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide by blocking the flow of air into the lungs, or by using up the space normally required for oxygen to come in and carbon dioxide to go out of the lung.

Symptoms of lung cancer may include:

    * Fatigue

    * Cough

    * Shortness of breath

    * Chest pain, if a tumor invades a structure within the chest or involves the lining of the lung

    * Loss of appetite

    * Coughing up phlegm or mucus

    * Hemoptysis (coughing up blood)

Although lung cancer can metastasize (spread) anywhere in the body, the most common sites of spread are the lymph nodes, lungs, bones, brain, liver, and structures near the kidneys called the adrenal glands. Metastases (spread to more than one area) from lung cancer can cause further breathing difficulties, bone pain, abdominal or back pain, headache, weakness, seizures, and/or speech difficulties. Rarely, a lung tumor can release hormones that result in chemical imbalances, such as low blood sodium levels or high blood calcium levels.

Symptoms such as fatigue, malaise (feeling out-of-sorts or unwell), and loss of appetite are not necessarily due to metastases. The presence of cancer anywhere in the body can cause a person to feel unwell in a general way. Loss of appetite can result in weight loss. Fatigue and weakness can further worsen breathing difficulties.

Diagnosis

Doctors use many tests to diagnose cancer and determine if it has spread from the lung. Some tests may also determine which treatments may be the most effective. For most types of cancer, a biopsy is the only way to make a definitive diagnosis of cancer. If a biopsy is not possible or more information is needed, the doctor may suggest other tests that will help make a diagnosis. Imaging tests may be used to find out whether the cancer has metastasized, but they can never be used to diagnose lung cancer. Only a biopsy can do that. Your doctor may consider these factors when choosing a diagnostic test:

    * Location of the suspected cancer

    * Size of the suspected cancer

    * Age and medical condition

    * The type of cancer suspected

    * Severity of symptoms

    * Previous test results

In addition to a physical examination, the following tests may be used to diagnose lung cancer:

Biopsy. A biopsy is the only way to make a diagnosis of lung cancer. A biopsy is the removal of a small amount of tissue for examination under a microscope. The sample removed from the biopsy is analyzed by a pathologist (a doctor who specializes in interpreting laboratory tests and evaluating cells, tissues, and organs to diagnose disease). If cancer cells are present, the pathologist will determine if it is small cell lung cancer or NSCLC, based on its appearance under the microscope.

Common procedures doctors use to obtain tissue for the diagnosis and staging of lung cancer are listed below:

Sputum cytology. If there is reason to suspect lung cancer, the doctor may ask a person to cough up some phlegm so it can be examined under the microscope. A pathologist can find cancer cells mixed in with the mucus.

Bronchoscopy. In this procedure, the doctor passes a thin, flexible tube with a light on the end into the mouth or nose, down through the main windpipe, and into the breathing passages of the lungs. A surgeon or a pulmonologist (a medical doctor who specializes in the diagnosis and treatment of lung disease) may perform this procedure. The tube lets the doctor see inside the lungs. Tiny tools inside the tube can take samples of fluid or tissue, so the pathologist can examine them. Patients are given mild anesthesia (medication to put them to sleep) during a bronchoscopy.

Needle aspiration. After numbing the skin, a special type of radiologist, called an interventional radiologist, inserts a small needle through the chest and directly into the lung tumor. The doctor uses the needle to aspirate (suck out) a small sample of tissue for testing. Often, the radiologist uses a chest CT scan or special x-ray machine called a fluoroscope to guide the needle.

Bone marrow biopsy. For patients with small cell lung cancer, doctors sometimes use a local anesthetic (to numb the area) and a special needle to remove a tiny piece of bone (typically from the hip bone) in order to determine whether small cell cancer is present within the bones.

Thoracentesis. After numbing the area, a needle is inserted through the chest wall and into the space between the lung and the wall of the chest where fluid can collect. The fluid is removed and checked for cancer cells by the pathologist.

Thoracotomy. This procedure is performed in an operating room with the help of general anesthesia. A surgeon then makes an incision in the chest, examines the lung directly, and takes tissue samples for testing. A thoracotomy is the procedure surgeons most often perform to completely remove a lung tumor.

Thoracoscopy. Through a small cut in the skin of the chest wall, a surgeon can insert a special instrument and a small video camera to assist in the examination of the inside of the chest. Patients require general anesthesia, but recovery time may be shorter given the smaller incisions. This procedure may be referred to as “VATS” (video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery).

Mediastinoscopy. A surgeon examines and takes a sample of the lymph glands in the center of the chest (underneath the breastbone) by making a small incision at the top of the breastbone. This procedure also requires general anesthesia and is done in an operating room.

Imaging tests

In addition to biopsies and surgical procedures, imaging scans are vital to the care of people with lung cancer. However, no test is perfect, and no scan can diagnose lung cancer. Only a biopsy can do that. Chest x-ray and scan results must be combined with a person’s medical history, a physical examination, blood tests, and biopsy information to form a complete story about where the cancer began and whether or where it has spread.

CT scan. This test produces images that allow doctors to see the size and location of lung tumors and/or lung cancer metastases.

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan. This test also produces images that allow doctors to see the size and location of lung tumors and/or lung cancer metastases. An MRI uses magnetic fields, not x-rays, to produce detailed images of the body. A contrast medium (a special dye) may be injected into a patient’s vein to provide better detail. MRI scanning is imprecise when used to image a structure that is moving, like your lungs, which move with each breath a person takes. For that reason, the MRI scan is rarely used to study the lungs themselves.

Scans are also available that use radioactive molecules, called tracers, injected into the blood to show where cancer is possibly located:

Positron emission tomography (PET) scan. A PET scan is a way to create pictures of organs and tissues inside the body. A small amount of a radioactive substance is injected into a patient’s body and absorbed by the organs or tissues being studied. This substance gives off energy that is detected by a scanner, which produces the images. A specialist in nuclear medicine helps your doctor interpret PET scans.

Bone scan. A bone scan uses a radioactive tracer to look at the inside of the bones. The tracer is injected into a patient’s vein. It collects in areas of the bone and is detected by a special camera. Healthy bone appears gray to the camera, and areas of injury, such as those caused by cancer, appear dark.

Bone scans and PET scans are often used in combination with information gathered from a CT scan, MRI, regular x-rays, and a physical examination.

Finding out where the cancer started

Lung cancer starts in the lungs. Many other types of cancer start elsewhere in the body and spread to the lungs when they metastasize. For example, breast cancer that has spread to the lungs is still called breast cancer. Therefore, it is important for doctors to know if cancer started in the lungs or elsewhere.

To find where the cancer started, the doctor takes into account the patient’s symptoms and medical history, physical examination, the appearance of the tumor on x-rays and scans, and risk factors for cancer. A pathologist can perform tests on the biopsy sample to help identify the origin of a cancer, and the doctor may order other tests for the patient to rule out specific types of cancer. If, after these considerations, the doctor is still not sure where the cancer started, the doctor may give a diagnosis of metastatic cancer “of unknown primary.” Most treatments for metastatic cancer of unknown primary that are first discovered in the chest are the same as those for metastatic lung cancer.

Staging With Illustrations

Staging is a way of describing a cancer, such as where it is located, if or where it has spread, and if it is affecting the functions of other organs in the body. Doctors use diagnostic tests to determine the cancer’s stage, so staging may not be complete until all of the tests are finished. Knowing the stage helps the doctor to decide what kind of treatment is best and can help predict a patient’s prognosis (chance of recovery). There are different stage descriptions for different types of cancer.

As doctors learn new information about lung cancer, the staging system may be updated or changed. The International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer (IASLC) is expected to issue updated staging information in 2009, and these changes may mean that more patients could be recommended for adjuvant chemotherapy (chemotherapy after surgery). Learn more about lung cancer Treatment.

In general, a lower number stage of lung cancer is associated with a better outcome. However, no doctor can predict how long a patient will live with lung cancer based only on the stage of disease, because lung cancer is different in each person, and individuals respond to treatment differently.

Staging is different for NSCLC and small cell lung cancer. Each staging system is described below.

Staging of NSCLC

The stage of NSCLC is described by a number, one through four (Roman numerals I through IV). One way to determine the staging of NSCLC is to determine whether the cancer can be completely removed by a surgeon. To completely remove the lung cancer, the surgeon must remove the cancer along with the surrounding, normal lung tissue.

Stage I and II

In general, NSCLC that is stage one (I) or two (II) has a size and location that makes it possible for a surgeon to completely remove it. Stage I cancer has not spread to any lymph nodes. Stage II cancer may involve lymph nodes, but the lymph nodes are contained within the surrounding lung, so they may be removed along with the section of lung where the cancer started.

Stage I Lung Cancer

Stage I Lung Cancer

Stage III

Stage three (III) NSCLC is difficult, and sometimes impossible, to remove. For example, lung cancer may spread to the lymph nodes located in the center of the chest, which is outside the lung. In this situation, it is less likely that the surgeon can completely remove the cancer because removal of the cancer has to be performed bit by bit.

When the cancer has spread to lymph nodes in the center of the chest, on the same side as where the cancer started, it is known as stage three-A (IIIA). When the cancer spreads to lymph nodes on the opposite side of the chest, it is known as stage three-B (IIIB). In general, surgery is not successful for any stage IIIB or IV lung cancer. Other situations that make a lung cancer impossible to remove are if it has spread to the lymph nodes above the collarbone or into the fluid surrounding the lung, or if the cancer grows into vital structures within the chest, such as the heart, large blood vessels or the main breathing tubes leading to the lungs; all of these conditions are considered stage IIIB.

Stage I Lung Cancer

Larger image

Stage IV

Stage four (IV) means NSCLC has spread to different sections (lobes) of the lung, or to distant sites within the body by way of the bloodstream. Once released in the blood, NSCLC can spread anywhere in the body, but has a tendency to spread to the brain, bones, liver, and to the adrenal glands.

Stage I Lung Cancer

Staging of small cell lung cancer

Because almost all small cell lung cancer has spread outside the lung when discovered, very few patients with small cell lung cancer are treated with surgery, and all receive chemotherapy. Some patients with small cell lung cancer can benefit from radiation therapy. The staging for small cell lung cancer helps identify which patients can be treated with radiation therapy in addition to chemotherapy.

Small cell lung cancer is classified as either limited stage or extensive stage:

    * Limited stage means the cancer is located on one side of the chest and involves a single region of the lung and adjacent lymph nodes. This region can be treated in its entirety with radiation therapy. About 30% of patients have limited stage.

    * Extensive stage means the cancer has spread to other regions of the chest, or outside of the chest, and cannot be treated completely with radiation therapy. Most patients (70%) have extensive stage disease and are treated with chemotherapy only.

Recurrent: Recurrent cancer is cancer that comes back after treatment.

Prognosis

The stage of lung cancer influences prognosis. While lung cancer is treatable at any stage, only certain stages of lung cancer can be cured. Some characteristics of patients are important to prognosis, regardless of whether the goal is treatment or cure.

Doctors measure a patient’s general strength and vigor using an index known as performance status. Patients who are strong enough to go about their daily activities without assistance and even work outside the home can safely receive chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and/or surgery. Treatment may not be as effective for patients with bone or liver metastases from lung cancer, excessive weight loss, ongoing cigarette use, or pre-existing medical conditions such as heart disease or emphysema.

It is important to note that a patient’s age has never been useful in predicting whether that patient will benefit from treatment. The average age of patients with lung cancer in the United States is 71. A patient’s age should never be used as the only reason for deciding on what treatment is best, especially for older patients who are otherwise physically fit and have no other medical problems besides lung cancer.
  Treatment

The treatment of lung cancer depends on the size and location of the tumor, whether the cancer has spread, and the person’s overall health. In many cases, a team of doctors will work with the patient to determine the best treatment plan.

This section outlines treatments that are the standard of care (the best treatments available) for this specific type of cancer. Patients are also encouraged to consider clinical trials when making treatment plan decisions. A clinical trial is a research study to test a new treatment to prove it is safe, effective, and possibly better than standard treatment. Your doctor can help you review all treatment options. For more information, read the clinical trials section.

There are four basic ways to treat lung cancer: surgery, radiation therapy, chemotherapy, and targeted therapy. Each treatment option is described below, followed by an outline of treatment by the type and stage of cancer.

Surgery

A thoracic surgeon is specially trained to perform lung cancer surgery. The goal of surgery is the complete removal of the lung tumor and the nearby lymph nodes in the chest. The tumor must be removed with a surrounding border of normal lung tissue (called the margin). A “negative margin” means that when the pathologist examines the lung, or piece of lung that has been removed by the surgeon, no traces of cancer were found in the healthy tissue surrounding the tumor.

The lungs have five lobes, three in the right lung and two in the left lung. For NSCLC, a lobectomy (removal of an entire lobe of the lung) has been shown to be the most effective type of surgery, even when the lung tumor is very small. If, for whatever reason, the surgeon cannot remove an entire lobe of the lung, the surgeon can remove the tumor in a procedure called a wedge, surrounded by a margin of normal lung. If the tumor is close to the center of the chest, the surgeon may have to perform a pneumonectomy (surgery to remove the entire lung). The time it takes to recover from lung surgery depends on how much of the lung is removed and the health of the patient before surgery.

Adjuvant therapy

Adjuvant therapy is treatment that is given after surgery to lower the risk of the lung cancer returning. Adjuvant therapy includes radiation therapy, chemotherapy, and targeted therapy. It is intended to eliminate any lung cancer cells that may be lingering in the body. Adjuvant therapy may decrease the risk of recurrence, but does not necessarily eliminate it.

Along with staging, other sophisticated tools can help determine prognosis and help you and your doctor make decisions about whether adjuvant therapy would be helpful in your treatment. The website Adjuvant! Online (www.adjuvantonline.com) is one such tool that your doctor can access to interpret a variety of factors that are important for making the treatment decision. This website should only be used with the interpretation of your doctor.

For additional information, read the What to Know: ASCO's Guideline on Adjuvant Treatment for Lung Cancer.

Radiation therapy

Radiation therapy is the use of high energy x-rays or other particles to kill cancer cells. If you need radiation therapy, you will be asked to see a specialist called a radiation oncologist. Like surgery, radiation therapy cannot be used to treat widespread cancer. Radiation only kills cancer cells directly in the path of the radiation beam. It also damages the normal cells caught in its path, and for this reason, it cannot be used to treat large areas of the body. Patients with lung cancer treated with radiation therapy often experience fatigue and loss of appetite. If radiation therapy is given to the neck, or center of the chest, patients may also develop a sore throat and have difficulty swallowing. Skin irritation, like sunburn, may occur at the treatment site. Most side effects go away soon after treatment is finished.

If the radiation therapy irritates or inflames the lung, patients may develop a cough, fever, or shortness of breath months and sometimes years after the radiation therapy ends. This condition occurs in about 15% of patients and is called radiation pneumonitis. If it is mild, radiation pneumonitis does not require treatment and resolves on its own. If it is severe, radiation pneumonitis may require treatment with steroid medications, such as prednisone. Radiation therapy may also cause permanent scarring of the lung tissue near the site of the original tumor. Typically, the scarring does not lead to symptoms. Widespread scarring can lead to permanent cough and shortness of breath. For this reason, radiation oncologists carefully plan the treatments using CT scans of the chest to minimize the amount of normal lung tissue exposed to the radiation beam.

Chemotherapy

Chemotherapy is the use of drugs to kill cancer cells. Systemic chemotherapy is delivered through the bloodstream, targeting cancer cells throughout the body. Chemotherapy is given by a medical oncologist. Most chemotherapy used for lung cancer is injected into a vein (called intravenous, or IV injection).

The side effects of chemotherapy depend on the individual and the dose used, but can include fatigue, risk of infection, nausea and vomiting, loss of appetite, and diarrhea. Nausea and vomiting are often avoidable; for more information, read the What to Know: ASCO's Guideline on Preventing Nausea and Vomiting Caused by Cancer Treatment. These side effects usually go away once treatment is finished.

Chemotherapy may also damage normal cells in the body, including blood cells, skin cells, and nerve cells. This may result in low blood counts, an increased risk of infection, hair loss, mouth sores, and/or numbness or tingling in the hands and feet. Your medical oncologist can often prescribe drugs to help provide relief from many side effects. Hormone injections are also used to prevent white and red blood cell counts from becoming too low.

Newer chemotherapy treatment plans cause fewer side effects and are as effective as older treatments. Chemotherapy has been shown to improve both the length and quality of life in people with lung cancer of all stages.

The medications used to treat cancer are continually being evaluated. Talking with your doctor is often the best way to learn about the medications prescribed for you, their purpose, and their potential side effects or interactions with other medications. Learn more about your prescriptions through Cancer.Net's Drug Information Resources, which provides links to searchable drug databases.

Targeted therapy

Targeted therapy is a treatment that target faulty genes or proteins that contribute to cancer growth and development. These abnormal proteins are present in unusually large amounts in certain lung cancer cells.

A monoclonal antibody is a drug made in the laboratory that blocks a receptor on the cell surface, which is like the doorway of the cell. Bevacizumab (Avastin) is a monoclonal antibody given in combination with chemotherapy for lung cancer. Drugs like bevacizumab block the formation of new blood vessels (also called angiogenesis), which is necessary for a tumor to grow and spread. The risk of serious bleeding for patients taking bevacizumab is about 2%.

Erlotinib (Tarceva) is a drug approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for locally advanced and metastatic NSCLC. It blocks the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), a protein that helps lung cancer cells grow and multiply. This medication is a pill that can be taken by mouth. The side effects of erlotinib include rash that looks like acne and diarrhea.

Many doctors recommend treatment with cetuximab (Erbitux), a monoclonal antibody that targets and blocks the EGFR. This is drug is given along with chemotherapy to treat lung cancer, especially when treatment with bevacizumab is unsafe. The side effects of cetuximab include rash and allergic reactions.

Gefitinib (Iressa) is another drug that works like erlotinib. It is available only to people who were already taking it, had taken it in the past and had a good effect, or as part of a clinical trial.

Combining treatments

Most patients with lung cancer are treated by more than one specialist with more than one type of treatment. For example, chemotherapy can be prescribed before or after surgery, or before, during, or after radiation therapy. Patients should have a sense that their doctors have a coordinated plan of care and are communicating effectively with one another. If patients do not feel that the surgeon, radiation oncologist, or medical oncologist is communicating effectively with them or each other about the goals of treatment and the plan of care, patients should discuss this with their doctors or seek additional opinions before treatment.

Treatment of NSCLC

Stage I and II. In general, stage I and II NSCLC are treated with surgery. Surgeons cure many patients with an operation. Before or after surgery, a patient may be referred to a medical oncologist. Some patients with a large tumor or evidence of spread to lymph nodes may benefit from neoadjuvant chemotherapy (chemotherapy before the surgery, also called induction chemotherapy) or adjuvant chemotherapy to reduce the chance the cancer will return. Radiation therapy is recommended to treat and cure a lung tumor in people for whom surgery is not advisable.

Stage III. Stage III NSCLC has spread to the point that surgery or radiation therapy alone is not enough to cure the disease for most people. Patients with stage III disease also have a high risk of the cancer returning, either in the same place or at a distant location, even after successful surgery or radiation therapy. For this reason, doctors generally do not recommend immediate surgery, and sometimes suggest chemotherapy with surgery to follow.

After chemotherapy, patients with stage IIIa NSCLC may still undergo surgery, especially if the chemotherapy is effective in killing or shrinking the cancer. Because chemotherapy travels throughout the body, if it is killing the cancer the doctors can see, it may also be killing the invisible cancer cells that may have spread from the original tumor. After effective chemotherapy, surgeons can be more confident that removing a stage IIIa NSCLC will result in a cure.

Some patients with stage IIIa NSCLC are not treated with surgery. Instead, patients with stage IIIa disease may be treated with a combination of chemotherapy and radiation therapy with the intent to cure. The chemotherapy may be delivered either before or at the same time as the radiation therapy. This method has shown to improve the ability of radiation therapy to shrink the cancer and to decrease the risk of the cancer returning. Chemotherapy delivered at the same time as radiation therapy is more effective than chemotherapy delivered before radiation therapy, but it results in more side effects. Patients who have received both chemotherapy and radiation therapy for stage IIIa disease may still go on to have surgery. However, there is debate among doctors whether surgery is necessary for patients effectively treated with radiation therapy and if radiation therapy is needed in patients whose tumors are completely removed following treatment with chemotherapy.

For most patients with NSCLC, the tumor is unresectable (cannot be removed by surgery). This may be because they have stage IIIb lung cancer, or the surgeon feels that an operation would be too risky, or that the tumor cannot be removed completely. For patients with unresectable NSCLC, with no signs of spread of cancer to distant sites or in the fluid around the lung, a combination of chemotherapy and radiation therapy can still be used to try to cure the patient.

Stage IIIb with pleural effusion and Stage IV NSCLC. Patients with stage IV NSCLC or stage IIIb due to malignant pleural effusion (cancer cells in the fluid around the lung) are typically not treated with surgery or radiation therapy. Rarely, doctors recommend that a brain or adrenal metastasis be removed surgically if that is the only place the cancer has spread. Radiation therapy can also be used to treat a single site of metastasis, such as in the brain. However, patients with stage IV disease, or stage IIIb with a pleural effusion, are at very high risk for the cancer spreading or growing in another location. Most patients with these stages of NSCLC are only treated with drugs.

The goals of chemotherapy are to shrink the cancer, relieve discomfort caused by the cancer, prevent further spread, and lengthen life. Rarely, chemotherapy can make metastatic lung cancer disappear. However, doctors know from experience that the cancer will return. Therefore, patients with stage IV disease, or stage IIIb with a pleural effusion, are never considered “cured” of their cancer no matter how well the chemotherapy works. These patients must be followed closely by their doctors and require lifelong chemotherapy to control their disease. Chemotherapy has been proven to improve both length and quality of life for patients with NSCLC.

For more information about NSCLC treatment that cannot be removed by surgery, read the What to Know: ASCO's Guideline on Advanced Lung Cancer Treatment.

Treatment of small cell lung cancer

As with NSCLC, the treatment of small cell lung cancer depends on the stage. Small cell lung cancer spreads quickly, so systemic chemotherapy is the primary treatment for all patients. The most commonly used chemotherapy regimen is etoposide (VePesid, Lastet, Etopoph plus cisplatin (Platinol) or carboplatin (Paraplatin). Patients with limited stage small cell lung cancer are best treated with simultaneous chemotherapy plus radiation therapy to the chest given twice a day. Radiation therapy is best when given during the first or second month of chemotherapy. Patients with extensive stage cancer are treated with chemotherapy only. Chemotherapy is given for three to six months. Surgery is rarely appropriate for patients with small cell lung cancer and is only considered for patients with very early-stage disease, such as a small lung nodule. In those cases, chemotherapy, with or without radiation therapy, is given afterwards.

In patients whose tumors have diminished after chemotherapy, radiation therapy to the head cuts the risk that the cancer will spread to the brain. This preventative radiation to the head is called prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI) and has been shown to extend the lives of these patients.

Like patients with advanced NSCLC, patients with small cell lung cancer of any stage face the risk that their cancer can return, even when it is initially controlled. All patients with small cell lung cancer must be followed closely by their doctors with x-rays, scans, and check-ups.

Stopping smoking

Even after lung cancer is diagnosed, it is still not too late to benefit from stopping cigarette smoking. People who stop smoking have an easier time with all treatments, feel better, live longer, and have a lower risk of developing a second lung cancer. Stopping smoking is never easy and even harder when facing the diagnosis of lung cancer and treatment. People who smoke should seek help from family, friends, smoking cessation programs, and health care professionals. None of the smoking cessation aids available interfere with cancer treatment. For more information, read the Tobacco section.

Controlling physical symptoms caused by lung cancer

Chemotherapy is not as effective as radiation therapy or surgery to treat lung cancer that has spread to the brain. For this reason, lung cancer that has spread to the brain is treated instead with radiation therapy, surgery, or both. Most patients with brain metastases from lung cancer are treated with radiation therapy to the entire brain. This can cause side effects such as hair loss, fatigue, and redness of the scalp. With a small tumor, a type of radiation therapy called stereotactic radiosurgery can focus radiation only on the tumor in the brain and minimize side effects.

Radiation therapy or surgery may also be used to treat metastases that are causing pain or other symptoms.

    * A tumor in the chest that is bleeding or blocking the lung passages can be shrunk by radiation therapy.

    * During a bronchoscopy (See Diagnosis), lung passages blocked by cancer can be opened to improve breathing.

    * A surgeon can use a laser to burn away a tumor or place a mechanical stent (support) to prop open an airway passage.

    * Bone metastases that weaken important bones can be treated with surgery and reinforced using metal implants. Bone metastases can also be treated with radiation therapy.

Medications can also help treat the symptoms of lung cancer.

    * Medications are used to treat cancer pain. Most hospitals and cancer centers have pain control specialists that design pain-relief treatments even for very severe cancer pain. Many drugs used to treat cancer pain, especially morphine, can also relieve shortness of breath caused by cancer.

    * Medications can be used to suppress cough, open closed airways, or reduce bronchial secretions.

    * Prednisone or methylprednisolone (multiple brand names) can reduce inflammation caused by lung cancer or radiation therapy and improve breathing.

    * Extra oxygen from small, portable tanks can help make up for the lung’s reduced ability to extract oxygen from the air.

    * Medications called bisphosphonates strengthen bones, lessen bone pain, and can help prevent future bone metastases.

    * Appetite stimulants and nutritional supplements can improve appetite and lessen weight loss.

Clinical Trials Resources

Doctors and scientists are always looking for better ways to treat patients with lung cancer. A clinical trial is a way to test a new treatment to prove that it is safe, effective, and possibly better than a standard treatment. Patients who participate in clinical trials are among the first to receive new treatments before they are widely available. However, there is no guarantee that the new treatment will be safe, effective, or better than a standard treatment.

Patients decide to participate in clinical trials for many reasons. For some patients, a clinical trial is the best treatment option available. Because standard treatments are not perfect, patients are willing to face the added uncertainty of a clinical trial in the hope of a better result. Other patients volunteer for clinical trials because they know that finding new drugs and other therapies is the only way to make progress in treating lung cancer. Even if they do not benefit directly from the clinical trial, their participation may benefit future patients with lung cancer.

To join a clinical trial, patients must complete a learning process known as informed consent. During informed consent, the doctor will list all of the patient’s options, so the person understands how the new treatment differs from the standard treatment. The doctor must also explain all of the risks of the new treatment, which may or may not be different from the risks of standard treatment. Finally, the doctor must detail what will be required of each patient in order to participate in the clinical trial, including the number of doctor visits, tests, and the schedule of treatment. Learn more about clinical trials, including patient safety, phases of a clinical trial, deciding to participate in a clinical trial, questions to ask the research team, and links to find cancer clinical trials.
Side Effects

Cancer and its treatment can cause a variety of side effects. However, doctors have made major strides in recent years in reducing pain, nausea and vomiting, and other physical side effects of cancer treatments. Many treatments used today are less intensive but as effective as treatments used in the past. Doctors also have many ways to provide relief to patients when such side effects do occur.

Fear of treatment side effects is common after a diagnosis of cancer, but it may be helpful to know that preventing and controlling side effects is a major focus of your health care team. Before treatment begins, talk with your doctor about possible side effects of the specific treatments you will be receiving. The specific side effects that can occur depend on a variety of factors, including the type of cancer, its location, the individual treatment plan (including the length and dosage of treatment), and the person’s overall health.

Ask your doctor which side effects are most likely to happen (and which are not), when side effects are likely to occur, and how they will be addressed by the health care team if they do happen. Also, be sure to communicate with your doctor about side effects you experience during and after treatment. For more information on the most common side effects of cancer and different treatments, along with ways to prevent or control them, visit Cancer.Net’s section on Managing Side Effects, based on ASCO’s curriculum.

In addition to physical side effects, there may be psychosocial (emotional and social) effects as well. Learn more about the importance of addressing these needs in Cancer.Net’s section on Caring for the Whole Patient.

For more information on late effects or long-term side effects, please read the After Treatment section or talk with your doctor.
Living With Cancer

Living With Lung Cancer

Because lung cancer is associated with smoking, patients may feel that they will not receive as much support or help from people around them because they believe that others will think that their behavior caused the disease. The truth is that most smokers do not develop lung cancer, and not all patients with lung cancer smoke. Lung cancer is a disease that affects all people. In fact, most people who get lung cancer today either have stopped smoking years earlier, or have never smoked.

For many patients, a diagnosis of lung cancer can be very stressful, and at times difficult to bear. Some patients with lung cancer develop anxiousness, and less commonly, depression. Patients and their families should not be afraid to express the way they are feeling to doctors, nurses, and social workers. The health care team is there to help, and many team members have special skills and experience that can make things easier for patients and their families.

In addition to moral support and education, the doctor may prescribe anti-anxiety medications like alprazolam (Xanax) or lorazepam (Ativan, Lorazepam Intensol) and occasionally, antidepressants. He or she may refer the patient to a counselor, psychologist, social worker, or psychiatrist. Furthermore, patients and their families should be aware that there are resources available in the community to help people living with cancer. Some patients feel comfortable discussing their disease and experiences throughout treatment with their doctor, nurse, family, friends, or other patients. These patients may also join support groups or advocacy groups in order to increase awareness about lung cancer and to help fellow patients who are living with this disease.

A lung cancer diagnosis is serious. However, patients can be hopeful that their doctors can offer them effective treatment. They can take comfort knowing that the advances being made in the diagnosis and treatment of lung cancer will provide more and more patients with a chance for cure.
After Treatment

Each year, tens of thousands of people are cured of lung cancer in the United States. After treatment for lung cancer ends, your doctor will outline a program of tests and visits to monitor your recovery and to check that the cancer has not returned. This plan may include regular physical examinations and/or medical tests. During this period, any new problem without an obvious cause that lasts for more than two weeks should be brought to the attention of your doctor or nurse.

People treated for lung cancer may continue to have symptoms, even after treatment ends. Common post-treatment problems include pain, fatigue, and shortness of breath. Feelings of depression and anxiety may also persist after treatment, and fear of the cancer returning is very common. Often people feel that they have less support once the treatment has ended and that there is less assistance available from their doctors, nurses, and other programs, such as support groups. Your doctor, nurse, and social worker can help you develop a plan to manage any problems that persist after treatment. There are also many available resources specifically designed for people following treatment:

    * Cancer.Net: Survivorship

    * National Coalition for Cancer Survivorship (NCCS): Cancer Survival Toolbox

    * National Cancer Institute: Life After Cancer Treatment

    * American Cancer Society (ACS) Cancer Survivor Network

Nothing helps recovering people with lung cancer more than stopping smoking. There are many tools and approaches available. Enlist the support of your family, friends, nurses, and doctors—it is difficult to stop on your own.

People who develop lung cancer are at higher risk for developing a second lung cancer. Your doctor will recommend scans to monitor you for this possibility, so any new cancers can be detected as early as possible.

People recovering from lung cancer are encouraged to follow established guidelines for good health, such as maintaining a healthy weight, not smoking, eating a balanced diet, and having recommended cancer screening tests. Because many survivors of lung cancer have smoked cigarettes in the past, they are at very high risk for heart disease, stroke, emphysema, and chronic bronchitis. Certain cancer treatments can further increase these risks. Even for those who are non-smokers, returning to your usual health routines after cancer is important for your overall well being. Talk with your doctor to develop a plan that is best for your needs.

Moderate physical activity can help rebuild your strength and energy level. Recovering patients, even those using oxygen, are encouraged to walk for 15 to 30 minutes each day to improve their heart and lung functioning. Your doctor can help you create an appropriate exercise plan based upon your needs, physical abilities, and fitness level.

Current Research

Research for lung cancer is ongoing. The following advances are under investigation in clinical trials and may not be approved or available at this time. Always discuss all diagnostic and treatment options with your doctor.

Personalized therapy. Specific characteristics of patients and their tumors that can predict whether a certain chemotherapy or targeted therapy may work are being identified. To collect this information, patients will increasingly be asked to undergo additional analyses of the tumor samples obtained at the time of diagnosis. In the majority of patients where chemotherapy is recommended, not enough tumor tissue was removed during the biopsy that was used to diagnose their cancer for these additional studies. These patients will be asked to undergo additional biopsies to help plan therapy and, if part of a clinical trial, to aid the research to discover better ways to treat lung cancer.

Targeted therapy. The future of lung cancer therapy lies in the development of targeted therapy. There are hundreds of new drugs now being studied both in the laboratory and in clinical trials. Learn more about Understanding Targeted Treatments.

Better techniques for surgery and radiation therapy. Doctors are finding ways to improve the effectiveness of surgical and radiologic procedures while reducing the side effects of these procedures. Advances in all types of treatment will improve the ability of doctors to combine chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and surgery for the treatment of patients with all stages of lung cancer.

Improved screening. Lung cancer is more successfully treated in its early stages, which has raised interest in screening patients for lung cancer before it grows to the point that it causes symptoms. There are currently no proven screening tests for lung cancer. Advances in imaging techniques, such as low-dose, helical CT scanning, are currently under investigation, and may result in better methods to detect lung cancer early. In the future, molecules detected in the blood or sputum may suggest the presence of lung cancer before it shows up on a CT scan.

Reduced tobacco use. Even with the best methods for the early detection and treatment of lung cancer, the best way to save lives from lung cancer is through programs to reduce cigarette smoking. For most people, lung cancer is a highly preventable disease. Even for people with lung cancer, stopping smoking lets people live longer, lowers side effects, and lessens the chance of getting a second lung cancer. Quitting smoking is hard at any time, and even more so during cancer treatment. The health care team can help make it easier to quit smoking with nicotine replacement and other techniques.
Questions to Ask the Doctor

Regular communication with your doctor is important in making informed decisions about your health care. Consider asking the following questions of your doctor:

For all patients with lung cancer:

    * What type of lung cancer do I have?

    * What is the stage of my lung cancer? What does this mean?

    * Should I see another doctor to assist in my care, such as a thoracic surgeon, radiation oncologist, medical oncologist, and/or pulmonologist? What is the role of each doctor in my care?

    * Do I need additional scans or biopsies in order to plan my treatment?

    * Can you explain my pathology report (laboratory test results) to me?

Lung Cancer - Non-Small Cell - Introduction
Approved by the Cancer.Net Editorial Board, 01/2019
ON THIS PAGE:You will find some basic information about this disease and the parts of the body it may affect. This is the first page of Cancer.Net’s Guide to Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer. Use the menu to see other pages. Think of that menu as a roadmap for this complete guide.

Lung cancer affects more than 200,000 Americans each year. Although cigarette smoking is the main cause, anyone can develop lung cancer. Lung cancer is always treatable, no matter the size, location, whether the cancer has spread, and how far it has spread.

Because lung cancer is associated with smoking, patients may feel that they won’t receive much support or help because they believe that others will think that their behavior caused the disease. The truth is that most smokers do not develop lung cancer, and not all people diagnosed with lung cancer smoke. Lung cancer is a disease that can affect anyone. In fact, most people who get lung cancer today have either stopped smoking years earlier or never smoked.

About the lungs
When a person inhales, the lungs absorb oxygen from the air and bring the oxygen into the bloodstream for delivery to the rest of the body. As the body’s cells use oxygen, they release carbon dioxide. The bloodstream carries carbon dioxide back to the lungs, and the carbon dioxide leaves the body when a person exhales. The lungs contain many different types of cells. Most cells in the lung are epithelial cells. Epithelial cells line the airways and make mucus, which lubricates and protects the lung. The lung also contains nerve cells, hormone-producing cells, blood cells, and structural or supporting cells.

About non-small cell lung cancer
There are 2 main classifications of lung cancer: small cell lung cancer and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). These 2 types are treated differently. This guide contains information about NSCLC. Learn more about small cell lung cancer in a separate guide on this website.

NSCLC begins when healthy cells in the lung change and grow out of control, forming a mass called a tumor, a lesion, or a nodule. A lung tumor can begin anywhere in the lung. A tumor can be cancerous or benign. Once a cancerous lung tumor grows, it may shed cancer cells. These cells can be carried away in blood or float away in the fluid, called lymph, that surrounds lung tissue. Lymph flows through tubes called lymphatic vessels that drain into collecting stations called lymph nodes. Lymph nodes are the tiny, bean-shaped organs that help fight infection. They are located in the lungs, the center of the chest, and elsewhere in the body. The natural flow of lymph out of the lungs is toward the center of the chest, which explains why lung cancer often spreads there first. When a cancer cell moves into a lymph node or to a distant part of the body through the bloodstream, it is called metastasis.

Types of NSCLC
NSCLC begins in the epithelial cells. NSCLC may also be described based on the type of epithelial cell where the cancer starts:

Adenocarcinoma starts in cells that produce mucus.

Squamous cell carcinoma begins in the cells that line the airways.

Large cell carcinoma begins in cells other than the 2 types described above.

It is important for doctors to distinguish between lung cancer that begins in the squamous cells from lung cancer that begins in other cells. This information is used to determine treatment options.

Lung Cancer - Non-Small Cell - Statistics
Approved by the Cancer.Net Editorial Board, 01/2019
ON THIS PAGE: You will find information about the number of people who are diagnosed with NSCLC each year. You will also read general information on surviving the disease. Remember, survival rates depend on several factors. Use the menu to see other pages.

NSCLC is the most common type of lung cancer, accounting for 84% of all lung cancer diagnoses.

Statistics provided below for lung cancer include both small cell and NSCLC. This year, an estimated 228,150 adults (116,440 men and 111,710 women) in the United States will be diagnosed with lung cancer. Lung cancer makes up about 13% of all new cancer diagnoses. Black men are about 20% more likely to get lung cancer than white men. Black women are 10% less likely to get cancer when compared with white women.

Lung cancer is the second most common cancer and the leading cause of cancer death for men and women. It is estimated that 142,670 (76,650 men and 66,020 women) deaths from this disease will occur this year.

Due to a decrease in smoking, death rates have declined by 48% since 1990 in men and 23% in women since 2002. From 2012 to 2016, the death rates for men with lung cancer dropped by 4% each year. The death rates for women with lung cancer declined 3% per year.

The 5-year survival rate tells you what percent of people live at least 5 years after the cancer is found. Percent means how many out of 100. The 5-year survival rate for all people with all types of lung cancer is 19%. The 5-year survival rate for men is 16%. The 5-year survival rate for women is 22%. The 5-year survival rate for NSCLC is 23%, compared to 6% for small cell lung cancer.

However, it is important to note that survival rates depend on several factors, including the subtype of lung cancer, and the stage of disease.

For people with localized NSCLC, which means the cancer has not spread outside of the lung, the overall 5-year survival rate is about 60%. For regional NSCLC, which means the cancer has spread outside of the lung to nearby areas, the 5-year survival rate is about 33%. If the cancer has spread to distant parts of the body, called metastatic lung cancer, the 5-year survival rate is 6%, but because of new effective therapies, this number is changing.

Each year, tens of thousands of people are cured of NSCLC in the United States. And, some patients with advanced lung cancer can live many years after diagnosis. Sometimes patients who are told that their lung cancer is incurable live longer than many who are told that their lung cancer is curable. The important thing to remember is that lung cancer is treatable at any stage, and these treatments have been proven to help people with lung cancer live longer with better quality of life.

Furthermore, it is important to remember that statistics on the survival rates for people with NSCLC are an estimate. The estimate comes from annual data based on the number of people with this cancer in the United States. Also, experts measure the survival statistics every 5 years. So the estimate may not show the results of better diagnosis or treatment available for less than 5 years. Talk with your doctor if you have any questions about this information. Learn more about understanding statistics.

The next section in this guide is Risk Factors and Prevention. It explains the factors that may increase the chance of developing NSCLC. Use the menu to choose a different section to read in this guide.

Lung Cancer - Non-Small Cell - Risk Factors and Prevention
Approved by the Cancer.Net Editorial Board, 01/2019
ON THIS PAGE: You will find out more about the factors that increase the chance of developing NSCLC. Use the menu to see other pages.

A risk factor is anything that increases a person’s chance of developing cancer. Although risk factors often influence the development of cancer, most do not directly cause cancer. Some people with several risk factors never develop cancer, while others with no known risk factors do. Knowing your risk factors and talking about them with your doctor may help you make more informed lifestyle and health care choices. NSCLC occurs most often in people who smoke or in those who have smoked in the past. However, people who don’t smoke can also develop NSCLC, so it is important for all people to learn about the risk factors and signs and symptoms of NSCLC.

The following factors may raise a person’s risk of developing NSCLC:

Tobacco and smoking. Tobacco smoke damages cells in the lungs, causing the cells to grow abnormally. The risk that smoking will lead to cancer is higher for people who smoke heavily and/or for a long time. Regular exposure to smoke from someone else’s cigarettes, cigars, or pipes can increase a person’s risk of lung cancer, even if that person does not smoke. This is called environmental or “secondhand” tobacco smoke.

Smoking marijuana and using electronic cigarettes may also increase the risk of lung cancer, but the actual risk is unknown.

Asbestos. These are hair-like crystals found in many types of rock and are often used as fireproof insulation in buildings. When asbestos fibers are inhaled, they can irritate the lungs. Many studies show that the combination of smoking and asbestos exposure is particularly dangerous. People who work with asbestos in a job such as shipbuilding, asbestos mining, insulation, or automotive brake repair and who smoke have a higher risk of developing NSCLC. Using protective breathing equipment reduces this risk.

Radon. This is an invisible, odorless gas naturally released by some soil and rocks. Exposure to radon has been associated with an increased risk of some types of cancer, including lung cancer. Most hardware stores have kits that test home radon levels, and basements can be ventilated to reduce radon exposure.

Other substances. Other substances such as gases or chemicals at work or in the environment can increase a person’s risk of developing lung cancer. In some parts of the world, people exposed to cooking flames from coal or wood might increase risk of lung cancer. Also, fumes from diesel gas or from soldering metals could increase the risk of lung cancer. Other factors that may increase the risk of lung cancer include exposure to radiation, arsenic, nickel, and chromium.

Genetics. Some people have a genetic predisposition for lung cancer. People with a parent, brother, or sister with lung cancer could have a higher risk of developing lung cancer themselves.

Prevention
Different factors cause different types of cancer. Researchers continue to look into what factors cause this type of cancer, including ways to prevent it. Although there is no proven way to completely prevent this disease, you may be able to lower your risk. Talk with your health care team for more information about your personal risk of cancer.

The most important way to prevent lung cancer is to avoid tobacco smoke. People who never smoke have the lowest risk of lung cancer. People who smoke can reduce their risk of lung cancer by stopping smoking, but their risk of lung cancer will still be higher than people who never smoked.

Attempts to prevent lung cancer with vitamins or other treatments have not worked. For instance, beta-carotene, a drug related to vitamin A, has been tested for the prevention of lung cancer. It did not reduce the risk of cancer. In people who continued to smoke, beta-carotene actually increased the risk of lung cancer.

The next section in this guide is Screening. It explains how tests may find cancer before signs or symptoms appear. Use the menu to choose a different section to read in this guide

Lung Cancer - Non-Small Cell - Screening
Approved by the Cancer.Net Editorial Board, 01/2019
ON THIS PAGE: You will find out more about screening for this type of NSCLC. You will also learn the risks and benefits of screening. Use the menu to see other pages.

Screening is used to look for cancer before you have any symptoms or signs. Scientists have developed, and continue to develop, tests that can be used to screen a person for specific types of cancer. The overall goals of cancer screening are to lower the number of people who die from the disease or eliminate deaths from cancer altogether.

Learn more about the basics of cancer screening.

Screening information for lung cancer
Several groups, including ASCO, provide recommendations for lung cancer screening.

Screening for lung cancer is done with a test called a low-dose helical or spiral computed tomography (CT or CAT) scan. A CT scan takes pictures of the inside of the body with an x-ray machine. A computer then combines these pictures into a detailed, 3-dimensional image that shows any abnormalities or tumors.

CT scanning is not recommended for every person who smokes. The current recommendations are discussed below. It is also important to receive screening at an approved and experienced center. Lung cancer screening is approved by Medicare.

ASCO recommends the following lung cancer screening schedules for people who currently smoke or who have quit smoking:

Yearly screening with a low-dose CT scan is recommended for people age 55 to 74 who have smoked for 30 pack years or more. It is also recommended for those age 55 to 74 who have quit within the past 15 years.

CT screening is not recommended for people who have smoked for less than 30 pack years, are younger than 55 or older than 74, have quit smoking more than 15 years ago, or have a serious condition that could affect cancer treatment or shorten a person's life.

A pack year is equal to smoking 20 cigarettes (1 pack) a day each year.

The United States Preventive Services Task Force recommends that people age 55 to 80 who have smoked for 30 pack years or more or who have quit within the past 15 years receive screening for lung cancer with low-dose CT scans each year. Screening can stop after a person has not smoked for 15 years or develops a health problem that would shorten their life or prevent them from being able to have surgery for lung cancer.

Lung Cancer - Non-Small Cell - Symptoms and Signs
Approved by the Cancer.Net Editorial Board, 01/2019
ON THIS PAGE: You will find out more about body changes and other things that can signal a problem that may need medical care. Use the menu to see other pages.

People with NSCLC may experience the following symptoms or signs. Sometimes people with NSCLC do not have any of these changes. Or, the cause of a symptom may be a different medical condition that is not cancer.

Fatigue

Cough

Shortness of breath

Chest pain, if a tumor spreads to the lining of the lung or other parts of the body near the lungs

Loss of appetite

Coughing up phlegm or mucus

Coughing up blood

Unintentional weight loss

Hoarseness

If you are concerned about any changes you experience, please talk with your doctor. Your doctor will ask how long and how often you’ve been experiencing the symptom(s), in addition to other questions. This is to help figure out the cause of the problem, called a diagnosis.

For people with NSCLC who have no symptoms, the cancer may be noticed on a chest x-ray or CT scan performed for some other reason, such as checking for heart disease. Most people with NSCLC are diagnosed when the tumor grows, takes up space, or begins to cause problems with parts of the body near the lungs. A lung tumor may also make fluid that can build up in the lung or the space around the lung or push the air out of the lungs and cause the lung to collapse. This prevents oxygen from getting in the body and carbon dioxide from leaving the body by blocking the flow of air into the lungs, or by using up the space normally required for oxygen to come in and carbon dioxide to go out of the lung.

NSCLC can spread anywhere in the body through a process called metastasis. It most commonly spreads to the lymph nodes, other parts of the lungs, bones, brain, liver, and structures near the kidneys called the adrenal glands. Metastases from NSCLC can cause:

More breathing difficulties

Bone pain

Abdominal or back pain

Headache

Weakness

Seizures

Speech difficulties

Rarely, a lung tumor can release hormones that cause problems such as low blood sodium levels or high blood calcium levels.

Symptoms such as fatigue, feeling out-of-sorts or unwell, and loss of appetite are not necessarily caused by metastases. Cancer anywhere in the body can cause a person to feel unwell in a general way. Loss of appetite can cause weight loss and muscle loss. Fatigue and weakness can further worsen a person’s ability to breathe. Muscle loss also contributes to weakness and loss of mobility.

If cancer is diagnosed, relieving symptoms remains an important part of cancer care and treatment. This may be called palliative care or supportive care. It is often started soon after diagnosis and continued throughout treatment. Be sure to talk with your health care team about the symptoms you experience, including any new symptoms or a change in symptoms.

The next section in this guide is Diagnosis. It explains what tests may be needed to learn more about the cause of the symptoms. Use the menu to choose a different section to read in this guide.

Lung Cancer - Non-Small Cell - Diagnosis
Approved by the Cancer.Net Editorial Board, 01/2019
ON THIS PAGE: You will find a list of common tests, procedures, and scans that doctors use to find the cause of a medical problem. Use the menu to see other pages.

Doctors use many tests to find, or diagnose, cancer. They also do tests to learn if cancer has spread to another part of the body from where it started. If this happens, it is called metastasis. For example, imaging tests can show if the cancer has spread, but they can never be used alone to diagnose NSCLC. Imaging tests show pictures of the inside of the body. Doctors may also do tests to learn which treatments could work best.

For most types of cancer, a biopsy is the only sure way for the doctor to know if an area of the body has cancer. In a biopsy, the doctor takes a small sample of tissue for testing in a laboratory. If a biopsy is not possible, the doctor may suggest other tests that will help make a diagnosis.

This section describes options for diagnosing this type of cancer. Not all tests listed below will be used for every person. Your doctor may consider these factors when choosing a diagnostic test:

The type of cancer suspected

Your signs and symptoms

Your age and general health

The results of earlier medical tests

In addition to a physical examination, the following tests may be used to diagnose and learn the stage of lung cancer:

Imaging tests
Imaging scans are very important in the care of people with NSCLC. However, no test is perfect, and no scan can diagnose NSCLC. Only a biopsy can do that (see below). Chest x-ray and scan results must be combined with a person’s medical history, a physical examination, blood tests, and information from the biopsy to form a complete story about where the cancer began and if or where it has spread.

CT scan. A CT scan produces images that allow doctors to see the size and location of a lung tumor and/or lung cancer metastases. A CT scan takes pictures of the inside of the body using x-rays taken from different angles. A computer combines these pictures into a detailed, 3-dimensional image that shows any abnormalities or tumors. A CT scan can be used to measure the tumor’s size. Sometimes, a special dye called a contrast medium is given before the scan to provide better detail on the image. This dye can be injected into a patient’s vein or given as a pill or liquid to swallow.

Positron emission tomography (PET) scan. A PET scan is usually combined with a CT scan (see above), called a PET-CT scan. However, you may hear your doctor refer to this procedure just as a PET scan. A PET scan is a way to create pictures of organs and tissues inside the body. A small amount of a radioactive sugar substance is injected into the patient’s body. This sugar substance is taken up by cells that use the most energy. Because cancer tends to use energy actively, it absorbs more of the radioactive substance. A scanner then detects this substance to produce images of the inside of the body.

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan. An MRI also produces images that allow doctors to see the location of a lung tumor and/or lung cancer metastases and measure the tumor’s size. An MRI uses magnetic fields, not x-rays, to produce detailed images of the body. A special dye called a contrast medium is given before the scan to create a clearer picture. This dye can be injected into a patient’s vein or given as a pill or liquid to swallow. MRI scanning does not work well to take pictures of parts of the body that are moving, like your lungs, which move with each breath you take. For that reason, MRI is rarely used to look at the lungs. However, it may be helpful to find lung cancer that has spread to the brain or bones.

Bone scan. A bone scan uses a radioactive tracer to look at the inside of the bones. The tracer is injected into a patient’s vein. It collects in areas of the bone and is detected by a special camera. Healthy bone appears lighter to the camera, and areas of injury, such as those caused by cancer, stand out on the image. PET scans (see above) have been replacing bone scans to find NSCLC that has spread to the bones.

The procedures that doctors use to collect tissue to diagnose lung cancer and plan treatment are listed below:

Biopsy. A biopsy is the removal of a small amount of tissue for examination under a microscope. It is helpful to have a larger tumor sample to determine the subtype of NSCLC and do additional molecular testing (see below). If not enough of the tumor is removed to do these tests, another biopsy may be needed. After the biopsy, a pathologist analyzes the sample(s). A pathologist is a doctor who specializes in interpreting laboratory tests and evaluating cells, tissues, and organs to diagnose disease.

Bronchoscopy. In a bronchoscopy, the doctor passes a thin, flexible tube with a light on the end into the mouth or nose, down through the main windpipe, and into the breathing passages of the lungs. A surgeon or a pulmonologist may perform this procedure. A pulmonologist is a medical doctor who specializes in the diagnosis and treatment of lung disease. The tube lets the doctor see inside the lungs. Tiny tools inside the tube can take samples of fluid or tissue so the pathologist can examine them. Patients are given mild anesthesia during a bronchoscopy. Anesthesia is medication to block the awareness of pain.

Needle aspiration/core biopsy. After numbing the skin, a special type of radiologist, called an interventional radiologist, removes a sample of the lung tumor for testing. This can be done with a smaller needle or a larger needle depending on how large of a sample is needed. The doctor uses the needle to remove a sample of tissue for testing. Often, the radiologist uses a chest CT scan or special x-ray machine called a fluoroscope to guide the needle. In general, a core biopsy provides a larger amount of tissue than a needle aspiration. As explained above, doctors have learned that more tissue is needed in NSCLC for diagnosis and molecular testing.

Thoracentesis. After numbing the skin on the chest, a needle is inserted through the chest wall and into the space between the lung and the wall of the chest where fluid can collect. The fluid is removed and checked for cancer cells by the pathologist.

Thoracoscopy. Through a small cut in the skin of the chest wall, a surgeon can insert a special instrument and a small video camera to assist in the examination of the inside of the chest. Patients need general anesthesia for this procedure, but recovery time may be shorter with a thoracoscopy because of the smaller incisions that are used. This procedure may be referred to as video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery or VATS.

Mediastinoscopy. A surgeon examines and takes a sample of the lymph nodes in the center of the chest underneath the breastbone by making a small incision at the top of the breastbone. This procedure also requires general anesthesia and is done in an operating room.

Thoracotomy. This procedure is performed in an operating room, and the patient receives general anesthesia. A surgeon then makes an incision in the chest, examines the lung directly, and takes tissue samples for testing. A thoracotomy is the procedure surgeons most often use to completely remove a lung tumor.

Molecular testing of the tumor
Your doctor may recommend running laboratory tests on a tumor sample to identify specific genes, proteins, and other factors unique to the tumor.

There are several genes that may be changed, called mutations, in a lung tumor that can help the cancer grow and spread. These mutations are found in the tumor, and not in healthy cells in the body. This means that they are not inherited or passed down to your children. Mutations that are known to contribute to lung cancer growth often occur on 1 or more of several genes, including EGFR, ALK, KRAS, BRAF, HER2, ROS1, RET, MET, and TRK. Testing the tumor for some of these genes is now common for later-stage NSCLC. Testing for these genes may also be done for earlier stages of the disease.

Results from these molecular tests can help determine whether your treatment options include a type of treatment called targeted therapy, which can be directed at specific mutations (see Types of Treatment). Mutations for which targeted therapies exist are much more likely to occur in patients with the adenocarcinoma type of NSCLC and in patients who never smoked.

If you have later-stage NSCLC, your doctor may also recommend PD-L1 testing. PD-L1 is found on the surface of cancer cells and some of the body's immune cells. This protein stops the body’s immune cells from destroying the cancer. Knowing if the tumor has PD-L1 helps your doctor decide whether your treatment options include certain types of immunotherapy (see Types of Treatment). These types of immunotherapy block PD-L1 and allow the immune system to target the cancer.

After diagnostic tests are done, your doctor will review all of the results with you. If the diagnosis is cancer, these results also help the doctor describe the cancer. This is called staging.

Finding out where the cancer started
NSCLC starts in the lungs. Many other types of cancer start elsewhere in the body and spread to the lungs when they metastasize. For example, breast cancer that has spread to the lungs is still called breast cancer. Therefore, it is important for doctors to know if the cancer started in the lungs or elsewhere.

To find where the cancer started, your doctor will take into account your symptoms and medical history, physical examination, how the tumor looks on x-rays and scans, and your risk factors for cancer. A pathologist can perform tests on the biopsy sample to help find out where the cancer began. Your doctor may recommend other tests to rule out specific types of cancer. If, after these considerations, the doctor is still not sure where the cancer started, the doctor may give a diagnosis of metastatic cancer “of unknown primary.” Most treatments for metastatic cancer of unknown primary that are first found in the chest are the same as those for metastatic lung cancer.

Coping with a NSCLC diagnosis
For most patients, a diagnosis of NSCLC is extremely stressful. Some patients develop anxiety and, less commonly, depression. Patients and their families should not be afraid to talk with the health care team about how they feel. The health care team has special training and experience that can make things easier for patients and their families and is there to help.

In addition to information and emotional support, your doctor may prescribe anti-anxiety medication and occasionally, an antidepressant. Your doctor may also refer you to a counselor, psychologist, social worker, or psychiatrist. You and your family may also find resources available in the community to help people living with lung cancer, such as support groups. Some patients feel comfortable discussing their disease and experiences throughout treatment with their health care team, family, friends, or other patients through a support group. These patients may also join a support group or advocacy group in order to increase awareness about lung cancer and to help fellow patients who are living with this disease.

A NSCLC diagnosis is serious. However, your doctor can offer effective treatment for the cancer. In addition, advances being made in the diagnosis and treatment of NSCLC that provide more and more patients with a chance for cure.

Learn more about the counseling, finding a support group, and being a cancer advocate.

Stopping smoking
Even after NSCLC is diagnosed, it is still beneficial to quit smoking. People who stop smoking have an easier time with all treatments, feel better, live longer, and have a lower risk of developing a second lung cancer or other health problems. Stopping smoking is never easy and even harder when facing the diagnosis of NSCLC. If you smoke, seek help from family, friends, programs for quitting smoking, and health care professionals. None of the products available to quit smoking interfere with cancer treatment. Learn more about stopping tobacco use after a cancer diagnosis.

The next section in this guide is Stages. It explains the system doctors use to describe the extent of the disease. Use the menu to choose a different section to read in this guide.

Lung Cancer - Non-Small Cell - Stages
Approved by the Cancer.Net Editorial Board, 01/2019
ON THIS PAGE: You will learn about how doctors describe a cancer’s growth or spread. This is called the stage. Use the menu to see other pages.

Staging is a way of describing where the cancer is located, if or where it has spread, and whether it is affecting other parts of the body. Doctors use diagnostic tests to find out the cancer’s stage, so staging may not be complete until all of the tests are finished. Knowing the stage helps the doctor to decide what kind of treatment is best and can help predict a patient’s prognosis, which is the chance of recovery. There are different stage descriptions for different types of cancer.

In general, a lower number stage of NSCLC is linked with a better outcome. However, no doctor can predict how long a patient will live with lung cancer based only on the stage of disease. This is because lung cancer is different in each person and treatment works differently for each tumor.

Cancer stage grouping
The stage of NSCLC is based on a combination of several factors, including:

The size and location of the tumor

Whether it has spread to the lymph nodes and/or other parts of the body.

There are 5 stages for NSCLC: stage 0 (zero) and stages I through IV (1 through 4). One way to determine the staging of NSCLC is to find out whether the cancer can be completely removed by a surgeon. To completely remove the lung cancer, the surgeon must remove the cancer, along with the surrounding, healthy lung tissue. Learn more about treatment options for NSCLC.

Stage 0
This is called in situ disease, meaning the cancer is “in place” and has not grown into nearby tissues and spread outside the lung.

Stage I
A stage I lung cancer is a small tumor that has not spread to any lymph nodes, making it possible for a surgeon to completely remove it. Stage I is divided into 2 substages based on the size of the tumor:

Stage IA tumors are 3 centimeters (cm) or less in size. Stage IA tumors may be further divided into IA1, IA2, or IA3 based on the size of the tumor.

Stage IB tumors are more than 3 cm but 4 cm or less in size.

Stage II
Stage II lung cancer is divided into 2 substages:

A stage IIA cancer describes a tumor larger than 4 cm but 5 cm or less in size that has not spread to the nearby lymph nodes.

Stage IIB lung cancer describes a tumor that is 5 cm or less in size that has spread to the lymph nodes. A stage IIB cancer can also be a tumor more than 5 cm wide that has not spread to the lymph nodes.

Sometimes, stage II tumors can be removed with surgery, and other times, more treatments are needed.

Stage III
Stage III lung cancers are classified as either stage IIIA, IIIB, or IIIC. The stage is based on the size of the tumor and which lymph nodes the cancer has spread to. Stage III cancers have not spread to other distant parts of the body.

For many stage IIIA cancers and nearly all stage IIIB cancers, the tumor is difficult, and sometimes impossible, to remove with surgery. For example, the lung cancer may have spread to the lymph nodes located in the center of the chest, which is outside the lung. Or the tumor may have grown into nearby structures in the lung. In either situation, it is less likely that the surgeon can completely remove the cancer because removal of the cancer must be performed bit by bit.

Stage IV
Stage IV means the lung cancer has spread to more than 1 area in the other lung, the fluid surrounding the lung or the heart, or distant parts of the body through the bloodstream. Once cancer cells get into the blood, the cancer can spread anywhere in the body. But, NSCLC is more likely to spread to the brain, bones, liver, and adrenal glands. Stage IV NSCLC is divided into 2 substages:

Stage IVA cancer has spread within the chest and/or has spread to 1 area outside of the chest.

Stage IVB has spread outside of the chest to more than 1 place in 1 organ or to more than 1 organ.
In general, surgery is not successful for most stage III or IV lung cancers. Lung cancer can also be impossible to remove if it has spread to the lymph nodes above the collarbone. It can also be impossible to remove if it has grown into vital structures within the chest. These vital structures include the heart, large blood vessels, or the main breathing tubes leading to the lungs. In these situations, the doctor will recommend other treatment options.

Recurrent NSCLC
Recurrent cancer is cancer that has come back after treatment. If the cancer does return, there will be another round of tests to learn about the extent of the recurrence. These tests and scans are often similar to those done at the time of the original diagnosis.

Prognosis
The type and stage of NSCLC and the patient’s overall health influence prognosis. Although NSCLC is treatable at any stage, only some people with certain stages can be cured.

Doctors measure a patient’s general strength and health using an index known as performance status. Patients who are strong enough to go about their daily activities without assistance and work outside the home can safely receive chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and/or surgery. Treatment may not be as effective for patients with bone or liver metastases from lung cancer, excessive weight loss, ongoing cigarette use, or pre-existing medical conditions, such as heart disease or emphysema.

It is important to note that a patient’s age has never been useful in predicting whether a patient will benefit from treatment. The average age of patients with lung cancer in the United States is 71. A patient’s age should never be used as the only reason for deciding what treatment is best, especially for older patients who are otherwise physically fit and have no medical problems besides lung cancer.

Information about the cancer’s stage will help the doctor recommend a specific treatment plan. The next section in this guide is Types of Treatment. Use the menu to choose a different section to read in this guide.

Lung Cancer - Non-Small Cell - Types of Treatment
Approved by the Cancer.Net Editorial Board, 01/2019
ON THIS PAGE: You will learn about the different types of treatments doctors use for people with NSCLC. Use the menu to see other pages.

This section explains the types of treatments that are the standard of care for NSCLC. “Standard of care” means the best treatments known. When making treatment plan decisions, you are encouraged to consider clinical trials as an option. A clinical trial is a research study that tests a new approach to treatment. Doctors want to learn whether the new treatment is safe, effective, and possibly better than the standard treatment. Clinical trials can test a new drug, a new combination of standard treatments, or new doses of standard drugs or other treatments. Clinical trials are an option to consider for treatment and care for all stages of cancer. Your doctor can help you consider all your treatment options. Learn more about clinical trials in the About Clinical Trials and Latest Research sections of this guide.

Treatment overview
In cancer care, different types of doctors often work together to create a patient’s overall treatment plan that combines different types of treatments. This is called a multidisciplinary team. Cancer care teams include a variety of other health care professionals, such as physician assistants, oncology nurses, social workers, pharmacists, counselors, dietitians, and others.

Your doctors should have a coordinated plan of care and work effectively with one another. If you do not feel that the health care team is communicating effectively with you or each other about the goals of treatment and the plan of care, talk with your doctors or seek additional medical opinions before treatment.

There are 5 basic ways to treat NSCLC:

Surgery

Radiation therapy

Chemotherapy

Targeted therapy

Immunotherapy

Descriptions of the common types of treatments used for NSCLC are listed below, followed by an outline of the common treatment plans by stage. Your care plan also includes treatment for symptoms and side effects, an important part of cancer care.

Treatment options and recommendations depend on several factors, including the type and stage of cancer, possible side effects, and the patient’s preferences and overall health. Take time to learn about all of your treatment options and be sure to ask questions about things that are unclear. Talk with your doctor about the goals of each treatment and what you can expect while receiving the treatment. These types of talks are called “shared decision making.” Shared decision making is when you and your doctors work together to choose treatments that fit the goals of your care. Shared decision making is particularly important for NSCLC because there are different treatment options. Learn more about making treatment decisions.

Surgery
A surgical oncologist is a doctor who specializes in treating cancer using surgery. A thoracic surgeon is specially trained to perform lung cancer surgery. The goal of surgery is to completely remove the lung tumor and the nearby lymph nodes in the chest. The tumor must be removed with a surrounding border or margin of healthy lung tissue. A “negative margin” means that when the pathologist examined the lung or a piece of lung that was removed by the surgeon, no cancer was found in the healthy tissue surrounding the tumor.

The following types of surgery may be used for NSCLC:

Lobectomy. The lungs have 5 lobes, 3 in the right lung and 2 in the left lung. A lobectomy is the removal of an entire lobe of the lung. It is currently thought to be the most effective type of surgery, even when the lung tumor is very small.

A wedge resection. If the surgeon cannot remove an entire lobe of the lung, the surgeon can remove the tumor, surrounded by a margin of healthy lung.

Segmentectomy. This is another way to remove the cancer when an entire lobe of the lung cannot be removed. In a segmentectomy, the surgeon removes the portion of the lung where the cancer developed.

Pneumonectomy. If the tumor is close to the center of the chest, the surgeon may have to remove the entire lung.

The time it takes to recover from lung surgery depends on how much of the lung is removed and the health of the patient before surgery. Before surgery, talk with your health care team about the possible side effects from the specific surgery you will have. Learn more about the basics of cancer surgery.

Adjuvant therapy
“Adjuvant therapy” is treatment that is given after surgery. It is intended to get rid of any lung cancer cells that may still be in the body after surgery. This helps lower the risk of recurrence, though there is always some risk that the cancer will come back.

The types of adjuvant therapy used for NSCLC include radiation therapy and systemic therapies, such as chemotherapy, targeted therapy, and immunotherapy. Each therapy is described below.

Radiation therapy
Radiation therapy is the use of high energy x-rays or other particles to destroy cancer cells. If you need radiation therapy, you will see a specialist called a radiation oncologist. A radiation oncologist is the doctor who specializes in giving radiation therapy to treat cancer. The most common type of radiation treatment is called external-beam radiation therapy, which is radiation given from a machine outside the body. A radiation therapy regimen, or schedule, usually consists of a specific number of treatments given over a set period of time. This can vary from just a few days of treatment to several weeks.

Like surgery, radiation therapy cannot be used to treat widespread cancer. Radiation therapy only destroys cancer cells directly in the path of the radiation beam. It also damages the healthy cells in its path. For this reason, it cannot be used to treat large areas of the body.

Sometimes, CT scans (see Diagnosis) are used to plan out exactly where to direct the radiation to lower the risk of damaging healthy parts of the body. This is called intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) or stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT). It is not an option for all patients, but it may be used for patients with early-stage disease and small tumors when surgery is not an option.

Listen to a Cancer.Net Podcast on ASCO’s recommendations for radiation therapy for NSCLC.

Side effects of radiation therapy
People with lung cancer who receive radiation therapy often experience fatigue and loss of appetite. If radiation therapy is given to the neck or center of the chest, side effects can include a sore throat and difficulty swallowing. Patients may also notice skin irritation, similar to sunburn, where the radiation therapy was directed. Most side effects go away soon after treatment is finished.

If the radiation therapy irritates or inflames the lung, patients may develop a cough, fever, or shortness of breath months and sometimes years after the radiation therapy ends. About 15% of patients develop this condition, called radiation pneumonitis. If it is mild, radiation pneumonitis does not need treatment and goes away on its own. If it is severe, a patient may need treatment for radiation pneumonitis with steroid medications, such as prednisone (Rayos). Radiation therapy may also cause permanent scarring of the lung tissue near where the original tumor was located. The scarring does not usually cause symptoms. However, severe scarring can cause a permanent cough and shortness of breath. For this reason, radiation oncologists carefully plan the treatments using CT scans of the chest to lessen the amount of healthy lung tissue exposed to radiation (see above).

Learn more about the basics of radiation therapy.

Therapies using medication
Systemic therapy is the use of medication to destroy cancer cells. This type of medication is given through the bloodstream to reach cancer cells throughout the body. Systemic therapies are generally prescribed by a medical oncologist, a doctor who specializes in treating cancer with medication.

Common ways to give systemic therapies include an intravenous (IV) tube placed into a vein using a needle or in a pill or capsule that is swallowed (orally).

The types of systemic therapies used for NSCLC include:

Chemotherapy

Targeted therapy

Immunotherapy

Each of these types of therapies are discussed below in more detail. A person may receive 1 type of systemic therapy at a time or a combination of systemic therapies given at the same time. They can also be given as part of a treatment plan that includes surgery and/or radiation therapy.

The medications used to treat cancer are continually being evaluated. Talking with your doctor is often the best way to learn about the medications prescribed for you, their purpose, and their potential side effects or interactions with other medications. It is also important to let your doctor know if you are taking any other prescription or over-the-counter medications or supplements. Herbs, supplements, and other drugs can interact with cancer medications. Learn more about your prescriptions by using searchable drug databases.

Chemotherapy
Chemotherapy is the use of drugs to destroy cancer cells, usually by keeping the cancer cells from growing, dividing, and making more cells. It has been shown to improve both the length and quality of life for people with lung cancer of all stages.

A chemotherapy regimen, or schedule, usually consists of a specific number of cycles given over a set period of time. The type of lung cancer you have, such as adenocarcinoma or squamous cell carcinoma, affects which drugs are used for chemotherapy.

Common drugs used to treat lung cancer include either 2 or 3 drugs given together or 1 drug given by itself. Some common drugs include:

Carboplatin or cisplatin (both are available as generic drugs)

Docetaxel (Taxotere)

Gemcitabine (Gemzar)

Nab-paclitaxel (Abraxane)

Paclitaxel (Taxol)

Pemetrexed (Alimta)

Vinorelbine (Navelbine)

Chemotherapy may also damage healthy cells in the body, including blood cells, skin cells, and nerve cells. The side effects of chemotherapy depend on the individual and the dose used, but they can include fatigue, low numbers of blood cells, risk of infection, mouth sores, nausea and vomiting, loss of appetite, diarrhea, numbness and tingling in the hands and feet, and hair loss. Your medical oncologist can often prescribe drugs to help relieve many of these side effects. Hormone injections are used to prevent white and red blood cell counts from becoming too low. Nausea and vomiting are also often avoidable. Learn more about preventing nausea and vomiting caused by cancer treatment. These side effects usually go away after treatment is finished.

Learn more about the basics of chemotherapy.

Targeted therapy
Targeted therapy is a treatment that targets the cancer’s specific genes, proteins, or the tissue environment that contributes to cancer growth and survival. This type of treatment blocks the growth and spread of cancer cells while limiting damage to healthy cells.

Not all tumors have the same targets. To find the most effective treatment, your doctor may run tests to identify the genes, proteins, and other factors in the tumor. For some lung cancers, abnormal proteins are found in unusually large amounts in the cancer cells. This helps doctors better match each patient with the most effective treatment whenever possible. In addition, research studies continue to find out more about specific molecular targets and new treatments directed at them. Learn more about the basics of targeted treatments.

Targeted therapy for NSCLC includes:

Anti-angiogenesis therapy. Anti-angiogenesis therapy is focused on stopping angiogenesis, which is the process of making new blood vessels. Because a tumor needs the nutrients delivered by blood vessels to grow and spread, the goal of anti-angiogenesis therapies is to “starve” the tumor. The following anti-angiogenic drugs may be options for lung cancer:

Bevacizumab (Avastin, Mvasi) is an anti-angiogenic drug given along with chemotherapy for lung cancer. It may also be used along with chemotherapy and the immunotherapy drug tezolizumab (Tecentriq; see below) for metastatic NSCLC.

The risk of serious bleeding for patients taking bevacizumab is about 2%. However, it is more common for patients with squamous cell carcinoma, so bevacizumab is not recommended for patients with this type of NSCLC.

Ramucirumab (Cyramza) is approved for NSCLC along with the chemotherapy drug docetaxel.

Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitors. Researchers have found that drugs that block EGFR may be effective for stopping or slowing the growth of lung cancer.

Afatinib (Gilotrif) is an initial treatment option for NSCLC. It may also be an option for patients who have already received other treatments for squamous NSCLC. It is a type of drug called a tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI).

Dacomitinib (Vizimpro) is approved as an initial treatment for NSCLC that has an EGFR mutation. However, it is not frequently used.

Erlotinib (Tarceva) has been shown to work better than chemotherapy if the lung cancer has a mutation in the EGFR gene. It is an option for patients with locally advanced and metastatic NSCLC. It may also be used as a maintenance therapy for patients with NSCLC that has not grown or spread after at least 4 cycles of chemotherapy. This medication is a pill that can be taken by mouth. The side effects of erlotinib include a rash that looks like acne, and diarrhea.

Gefitinib (Iressa) is another option that was only available in Europe and Asia but now is also available in the United States.

Necitumumab (Portrazza) may be an option along with chemotherapy for squamous cell lung cancer. However, this drug is not commonly used.

Osimertinib (Tagrisso) is a first treatment option for some people with NSCLC whose tumors have EGFR mutations. Osimertinib is also approved for the treatment of metastatic NSCLC with an EGFR mutation when other drugs listed above no longer work.

Drugs that target other genetic changes. Researchers have found that targeting other genetic changes in lung tumors may help stop or slow the growth of NSCLC. Examples include:

Anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) inhibitors. Mutations in the ALK gene are found in about 5% of patients with NSCLC.

Drugs that target changes in a gene called ROS1.

A specific genetic change called an NTRK fusion. This type of genetic change is found in a range of cancers, including lung cancer.

The following are currently available drugs that target these other genetic changes:

Alectinib (Alecensa): targets ALK gene mutations

Brigatinib (Alunbrig): targets ALK mutations

Ceritinib (Zykadia): targets ALK gene mutations

Combination of dabrafenib (Tafinlar) and tremetinib (Mekinist): for BRAF V600E gene mutations, but not for ALK or ROS1 mutations

Crizotinib (Xalkori): targets ALK or ROS1 genes mutations

Larotrectinib (Vitrakvi): targets NTRK gene fusion

Lorlatinib (Lorbrena): targets ALK gene mutations

Talk with your doctor about possible side effects for a specific medication and how they can be managed.

Immunotherapy
Immunotherapy, also called biologic therapy, is designed to boost the body's natural defenses to fight the cancer. It uses materials made either by the body or in a laboratory to improve, target, or restore immune system function. For example, the PD-1 pathway may be very important in the immune system’s ability to control cancer growth. Blocking this pathway with PD-1 and PD-L1 antibodies has stopped or slowed the growth of NSCLC for some patients. The following drugs block this pathway:

Atezolizumab (Tecentriq)

Durvalumab (Imfinzi)

Nivolumab (Opdivo)

Pembrolizumab (Keytruda)

For most patients with advanced NSCLC that cannot be treated with a targeted therapy (see above), immunotherapy or immunotherapy plus chemotherapy is often the preferred initial treatment.

Different types of immunotherapy can cause different side effects. Common side effects include skin reactions, flu-like symptoms, diarrhea, and weight changes. Talk with your doctor about possible side effects for the immunotherapy recommended for you.

Learn more about the basics of immunotherapy.

Physical, emotional, and social effects of cancer
Cancer and its treatment cause physical symptoms and side effects, as well as emotional, social, and financial effects. Managing all of these effects is called palliative care or supportive care. It is an important part of your care that is included along with treatments intended to slow, stop, or eliminate the cancer.

Palliative care focuses on improving how you feel during treatment by managing symptoms and supporting patients and their families with other, non-medical needs. Any person, regardless of age or type and stage of cancer, may receive this type of care. And it often works best when it is started right after a cancer diagnosis. People who receive palliative care along with treatment for the cancer often have less severe symptoms, better quality of life, and report they are more satisfied with treatment.

Palliative treatments vary widely and often include medication, nutritional changes, relaxation techniques, emotional and spiritual support, and other therapies. You may also receive palliative treatments similar to those meant to get rid of the cancer, such as chemotherapy, surgery, or radiation therapy.

The following treatments may be given to help relieve the symptoms of NSCLC:

A tumor in the chest that is bleeding or blocking the lung passages can be shrunk with radiation therapy.

During a bronchoscopy (See Diagnosis), lung passages blocked by cancer can be opened to improve breathing.

A surgeon can place a stent to prop open an airway or use a laser to burn away a tumor.

Medications are used to treat cancer pain. Most hospitals and cancer centers have pain control specialists who provide pain relief, even for severe cancer pain. Many drugs used to treat cancer pain, especially morphine, can also relieve shortness of breath caused by cancer. Learn more about managing cancer pain.

Medications can be used to stop a cough, open closed airways, or reduce bronchial secretions.

Prednisone or methylprednisolone (A-Methapred, Depo-Medrol, Medrol, Solu-Medrol) can reduce inflammation caused by lung cancer or radiation therapy and improve breathing.

Extra oxygen from small, portable tanks can help make up for the lung’s reduced ability to extract oxygen from the air.

Medications are available to strengthen bones, lessen bone pain, and help prevent future bone metastases.

Appetite stimulants and nutritional supplements can improve appetite and reduce weight loss.

Before treatment begins, talk with your doctor about the goals of each treatment in the treatment plan. You should also talk about the possible side effects of the specific treatment plan and palliative care options.

During treatment, your health care team may ask you to answer questions about your symptoms and side effects and to describe each problem. Be sure to tell the health care team if you are experiencing a problem. This helps the health care team treat any symptoms and side effects as quickly as possible. It can also help prevent more serious problems in the future.

Treatment of NSCLC by stage
Stage I and II NSCLC
In general, stage I and stage II NSCLC are treated with surgery. Surgeons cure many people with an operation.

Before or after surgery, a patient may also meet with a medical oncologist. Some patients with large tumors or signs that the tumor has spread to the lymph nodes may benefit from chemotherapy. Chemotherapy may be given before the surgery, called neoadjuvant chemotherapy or induction chemotherapy. Chemotherapy may also be given after surgery, called adjuvant chemotherapy, to reduce the chance that the cancer will return.

Adjuvant chemotherapy with cisplatin is not recommended for patients with stage IA NSCLC that was completely removed with surgery. Patients with stage IB lung cancers should talk with their doctors about whether chemotherapy is right for them after surgery. Adjuvant cisplatin-based chemotherapy is recommended for patients with stage II NSCLC that has been completely removed with surgery. Patients with stage II NSCLC should talk with their doctor about whether this treatment is right for them.

Stage III NSCLC
More than 30,000 people are diagnosed with stage III NSCLC every year, and there is no single best treatment for all of these patients. Treatment options depend on the size and location of the tumor and the lymph nodes that are involved. The options generally include:

Radiation therapy

Chemotherapy

Immunotherapy

Surgery

In general, people with stage III NSCLC receive 3 different types of treatment. A combination of chemotherapy and radiation therapy followed by immunotherapy is usually recommended for NSCLC that cannot be removed with surgery. Chemotherapy and radiation therapy may be given together, which is called concurrent chemoradiotherapy. Or, they may be given one after the other, called sequential chemoradiotherapy.

Adjuvant cisplatin-based chemotherapy is recommended for people with stage IIIA lung cancers that have been completely removed with surgery. Patients should talk with their doctor about the best treatment options for them.

Surgery may be an option after initial chemotherapy or chemotherapy with radiation therapy. Sometimes, surgery may be the first treatment, particularly when cancer is found in the lymph nodes unexpectedly after a person has originally been diagnosed with stage I or stage II cancer. If this occurs, surgery is generally followed by chemotherapy and often radiation therapy.

Metastatic or stage IV NSCLC
If cancer spreads to another part in the body from where it started, doctors call it metastatic cancer. If this happens, it is a good idea to talk with doctors who have experience in treating it. Doctors can have different opinions about the best standard treatment plan. Clinical trials might also be an option. Learn more about getting a second opinion before starting treatment, so you are comfortable with your chosen treatment plan.

Patients with stage IV NSCLC typically do not receive surgery or radiation therapy as the main treatment. Occasionally, doctors may recommend surgery for a metastasis in the brain or adrenal gland if that is the only place the cancer has spread. People with stage IV disease have a very high risk of the cancer spreading or growing in another location. Most patients with this stage of NSCLC receive systemic therapies, such as chemotherapy, targeted therapy, or immunotherapy. Palliative care will also be important to help relieve symptoms and side effects.

Systemic therapy for metastatic or stage IV NSCLC
The goals of systemic therapies are to shrink the cancer, relieve discomfort caused by the cancer, prevent the cancer from spreading further, and lengthen a patient’s life. These treatments can occasionally make metastatic lung cancer disappear. However, doctors know from experience that the cancer will usually return. Therefore, patients with stage IV disease are never considered “cured” of their cancer no matter how well treatment works. Treatment often continues as long as it is controlling the cancer’s growth. Systemic therapy and palliative care have been proven to improve both length and quality of life for patients with stage IV NSCLC. If the cancer worsens or causes too many severe side effects, the treatment may be stopped. Patients would continue to receive palliative care and may be offered treatment in a clinical trial.

The first drug or combination of drugs a patient takes is called “first-line” treatment, which may be followed by “second-line” and “third-line” treatment. No specific treatment or combination of treatments works for every patient. If the first-line treatment causes too many or dangerous side effects, does not appear to be working, or stops working, the doctor may recommend a change in treatment. ASCO’s recommendations for systemic therapies for NSCLC are included below. All patients should also receive palliative care.

First-line treatment. First-line systemic therapy for NSCLC often depends on the genetic changes found in the tumor.

For patients with tumors that do not have changes in the EGFR, ALK, or ROS1 genes, the options include:

Immunotherapy or immunotherapy plus chemotherapy for patients with tumors that have a high level of the PD-L1 protein.

Chemotherapy with a combination of drugs for people with tumors that do not have high levels of PD-L1. This may include bevacizumab for patients with non-squamous cell carcinoma who are receiving carboplatin and paclitaxel.

Immunotherapy may also be added to chemotherapy with carboplatin and pemetrexed for patients with non-squamous cell carcinoma.

For patients with tumors that have a genetic change on the EGFR gene, the following targeted therapies called TKIs may be options:

Afatinib

Dacomitinib

Erlotinib

Gefitinib

Osimertinib

For patients with tumors that have a genetic change on the ALK gene, targeted therapy options are alectinib, brigatinib, ceritinib, or crizotinib.

For patients with tumors that have a genetic change on the ROS1 gene, crizotinib is an option.

Second-line treatment. Second-line treatment for NSCLC depends on the gene mutations found in the tumor and the treatments patients have already received.

For patients with tumors that do not have changes in the EGFR, ALK, or ROS1 genes, the options include:

Nivolumab, pembrolizumab, or atezolizumab if they have a high level of PD-L1, received chemotherapy for first-line treatment, and have not received immunotherapy.

Nivolumab, atezolizumab, or chemotherapy if they have a low or unknown level of PD-L1 and have already received chemotherapy.

Chemotherapy for patients who have already received immunotherapy.

Docetaxel or docetaxel plus ramucirumab for patients who had severe side effects from immunotherapy.

Pemetrexed for patients with non-squamous cell carcinoma who did not receive it during first-line treatment.

For patients with tumors that have an EGFR gene mutation, the best treatment option depends on how the cancer worsened and whether the cancer developed a mutation called T790M, which makes it resistant to the TKI. Options include:

Osimertinib

Additional chemotherapy

Continued treatment with a TKI, plus surgery or radiation therapy to the areas where the cancer has spread

For patients with tumors that have an ALK gene mutation, options are:

Alectinib

Brigatinib

Ceritinib

Lorlatinib

For patients with tumors that have a ROS1 gene mutation, treatment options depend on the treatments received previously:

Crizotinib, if patients have not already received it

Chemotherapy, which may be given along with bevacizumab

For patients with tumors that have a BRAF mutation, options depend on whether they have already received immunotherapy:

Atezolizumab, nivolumab, or pembrolizumab for patients who have not already received any of these immunotherapies

Dabrafenib or a combination of dabrafenib and trametinib for patients who have already received immunotherapy

Third-line treatment. Third-line treatment for NSCLC is usually chemotherapy with pemetrexed or docetaxel.

Radiation therapy for brain metastases
Chemotherapy is often not as effective as radiation therapy or surgery to treat NSCLC that has spread to the brain. For this reason, NSCLC that has spread to the brain is usually treated with radiation therapy, surgery, or both. This can cause side effects such as hair loss, fatigue, and redness of the scalp. With a small tumor, a type of radiation therapy called stereotactic radiosurgery can focus the radiation only on the tumor in the brain and lessen the side effects.

Newer targeted therapies, such as osimertinib and alectinib, have shown that they can work well to treat brain metastases. In addition, immunotherapy may also be an option. This may allow many patients to have a systemic therapy for brain metastases and avoid the side effects that come from chemotherapy and radiation therapy to the brain.

Palliative care
As described above, palliative care will also be important to help relieve symptoms and side effects. Radiation therapy or surgery may also be used to treat metastases that are causing pain or other symptoms. Bone metastases that weaken major bones can be treated with surgery, and the bones can be reinforced using metal implants.

For most people, a diagnosis of metastatic cancer is very stressful and, at times, difficult to bear. You and your family are encouraged to talk about how you feel with doctors, nurses, social workers, or other members of the health care team. It may also be helpful to talk with other patients, including through a support group.

Remission and the chance of recurrence
A remission is when cancer cannot be detected in the body and there are no symptoms. This may also be called having “no evidence of disease” or NED.

A remission may be temporary or permanent. This uncertainty causes many people to worry that the cancer will come back. While many remissions are permanent, it is important to talk with your doctor about the possibility of the cancer returning. Understanding your risk of recurrence and the treatment options may help you feel more prepared if the cancer does return. Learn more about coping with the fear of recurrence.

If the cancer returns after the original treatment, it is called recurrent cancer. It may come back in the same place (called a local recurrence), nearby (regional recurrence), or in another place (distant recurrence). Most often, when there is recurrence, it is stage IV disease.

When this is a recurrence, a new cycle of testing will begin again to learn as much as possible about the recurrence. After this testing is done, you and your doctor will talk about the treatment options. Often the treatment plan will include the treatments described above such as surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation therapy, but they may be used in a different combination or given at a different pace. Your doctor may suggest clinical trials that are studying new ways to treat this type of recurrent cancer. Whichever treatment plan you choose, palliative care will be important for relieving symptoms and side effects.

People with recurrent cancer often experience emotions such as disbelief or fear. You are encouraged to talk with the health care team about these feelings and ask about support services to help you cope. Learn more about dealing with cancer recurrence.

If treatment does not work
Recovery from cancer is not always possible. If the cancer cannot be cured or controlled, the disease may be called advanced or terminal.

This diagnosis is stressful, and for many people, advanced cancer is difficult to discuss. However, it is important to have open and honest conversations with your health care team to express your feelings, preferences, and concerns. The health care team has special skills, experience, and knowledge to support patients and their families and is there to help. Making sure a person is physically comfortable, free from pain, and emotionally supported is extremely important.

People who have advanced cancer and who are expected to live less than 6 months may want to consider hospice care. Hospice care is designed to provide the best possible quality of life for people who are near the end of life. You and your family are encouraged to talk with the health care team about hospice care options, which include hospice care at home, a special hospice center, or other health care locations. Nursing care and special equipment can make staying at home a workable option for many families. Learn more about advanced cancer care planning.

After the death of a loved one, many people need support to help them cope with the loss. Learn more about grief and loss.

Lung Cancer - Non-Small Cell - About Clinical Trials
Approved by the Cancer.Net Editorial Board, 01/2019
ON THIS PAGE: You will learn more about clinical trials, which are the main way that new medical approaches are tested to see how well they work. Use the menu to see other pages.

What are clinical trials?
Doctors and scientists are always looking for better ways to care for people with NSCLC. To make scientific advances, doctors create research studies involving volunteers, called clinical trials. In fact, every drug that is now approved by the FDA was tested in clinical trials. Doctors generally do clinical research in distinct phases that have different goals. Learn more about the phases of clinical trials.

Clinical trials are used for all types and stages of NSCLC. Many focus on new treatments to learn if a new treatment is safe, effective, and possibly better than the existing treatments. These studies evaluate new drugs and methods of treatment, new approaches to treatment, and new prevention methods.

People who participate in clinical trials can be some of the first to get a treatment before it is available to the public. However, there are some risks with a clinical trial, including possible side effects and the chance that the new treatment may not work. People are encouraged to talk with their health care team about the pros and cons of joining a specific study.

Some clinical trials study new ways to relieve symptoms and side effects during treatment. Others study ways to manage the late effects that may happen a long time after treatment. Talk with your doctor about clinical trials for symptoms and side effects.

Deciding to join a clinical trial
People decide to participate in clinical trials for many reasons. For some people, a clinical trial is the best treatment option available. Because standard treatments are not perfect, people are willing to face the added uncertainty of a clinical trial in the hope of a better result. Other people volunteer for clinical trials because they know that these studies are a way to contribute to the progress in treating NSCLC. Even if they do not benefit directly from the clinical trial, their participation may benefit future patients with NSCLC.

Insurance coverage and the costs of clinical trials differ by location and by study. In some programs, some of the expenses from participating in the clinical trial are reimbursed. In others, they are not. It is important to talk with the research team and your insurance company first to learn if and how your treatment in a clinical trial will be covered. Learn more about health insurance coverage of clinical trials.

Sometimes people have concerns that, in a clinical trial, they may receive no treatment by being given a placebo or a “sugar pill.” When used, placebos are usually combined with standard treatment in most cancer clinical trials. When a placebo is used in a study, it is done with the full knowledge of the participants. Find out more about placebos in cancer clinical trials.

Patient safety and informed consent
To join a clinical trial, people must participate in a process known as informed consent. During informed consent, the doctor should:

Describe all of the treatment options so that the person understands how the new treatment differs from the standard treatment.

List all of the risks of the new treatment, which may or may not be different from the risks of standard treatment.

Explain what will be required of each person in order to participate in the clinical trial, including the number of doctor visits, tests, and the schedule of treatment.

Clinical trials also have certain rules called “eligibility criteria” that help structure the research and keep patients safe. You and the research team will carefully review these criteria together.

People who participate in a clinical trial may stop participating at any time for personal or medical reasons. This may include that the new treatment is not working or there are serious side effects. Clinical trials are also closely monitored by experts who watch for any problems with each study. It is important that people participating in a clinical trial talk with their doctor and researchers about who will be providing their treatment and care during the clinical trial, after the clinical trial ends, and/or if they choose to leave the clinical trial before it ends.

Lung Cancer - Non-Small Cell - Latest Research
Approved by the Cancer.Net Editorial Board, 01/2019
ON THIS PAGE: You will read about the scientific research being done to learn more about this type of cancer and how to treat it. Use the menu to see other pages.

Doctors are working to learn more about NSCLC, ways to prevent it, how to best treat it, and how to provide the best care to people diagnosed with this disease. The following areas of research may include new options for patients through clinical trials. Always talk with your doctor about the best diagnostic and treatment options for you.

Personalized drug therapy. Researchers are looking at features of lung tumors that can predict whether a specific drug, such as chemotherapy or targeted therapy, may be effective. To collect this information, patients are increasingly being asked to have additional analyses of the tumor samples taken when the disease is first diagnosed. In many patients for whom chemotherapy is recommended, the amount of tumor tissue removed during the biopsy to diagnose their cancer is not enough for these additional tests. These patients may be asked to have another biopsy to help plan treatment and, if part of a clinical trial, to help researchers find better ways to treat lung cancer. Learn more about personalized therapy.

Targeted therapy. Researchers are looking at gene and protein changes that could be new targets for treatment. These include changes called met exon 14 skipping mutations, NTRK translocations, HER-2 mutations, and RET translocations.

Immunotherapy. Promising results in immunotherapy for NSCLC and the recent approval of multiple types of immunotherapy are leading to more research on using these types of drugs to help the immune system control NSCLC growth.

Better techniques for surgery and radiation therapy. Doctors are finding ways to improve the effectiveness of surgery and radiation therapy while reducing the side effects of these procedures. For example, a current study is comparing the removal of the cancer and the nearby lung tissue with lobectomy for early-stage NSCLC. Other studies are looking at video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS), which allows the surgery to be done through smaller openings in the chest. Stereotactic radiation therapy is also being studied for NSCLC. This technique is used to focus radiation therapy more directly on the cancer and avoids more of the healthy tissue. Advances in all types of treatment will improve doctors’ ability to combine medication, radiation therapy, and surgery for the treatment of all stages of NSCLC.

Improved screening. NSCLC is more successfully treated in its early stages, which has raised interest in screening people for lung cancer before it causes signs and symptoms. Researchers are studying free-floating cancer DNA from blood tests to learn if these tests could help find molecular changes that can be used to plan treatment. These tests are often called circulating tumor DNA tests and may also be referred to as a “liquid biopsy.” Genetic testing to learn which people have a higher risk of lung cancer is also being researched.

Stopping tobacco use. Even with the best methods for the early detection and treatment of lung cancer, the best way to save lives from lung cancer is through programs to encourage people to never begin smoking and, if they have, quit cigarette smoking. For most people, lung cancer is a highly preventable disease. Even for people diagnosed with lung cancer, stopping smoking lengthens their lives, lowers side effects, and lessens their chance of getting a second lung cancer. Quitting smoking is hard at any time, and even more so during cancer treatment. The health care team can help make it easier to quit smoking with nicotine replacement and other techniques. Research continues into new ways to help people stop smoking.

Palliative care/supportive care. Clinical trials are underway to find better ways of reducing symptoms and side effects of current lung cancer treatments to improve comfort and quality of life for patients.

The next section in this guide is Coping with Treatment. It offers some guidance in how to cope with the physical, emotional, social, and financial changes that cancer and its treatment can bring. Use the menu to choose a different section to read in this guide.

Lung Cancer - Non-Small Cell - Coping with Treatment
Approved by the Cancer.Net Editorial Board, 01/2019
ON THIS PAGE: You will learn more about coping with the physical, emotional, social, and financial effects of cancer and its treatment. Use the menu to see other pages.

Every cancer treatment can cause side effects or changes to your body and how you feel. For many reasons, people do not experience the same side effects even when they are given the same treatment for the same type of cancer. This can make it hard to predict how you will feel during treatment.

As you prepare to start cancer treatment, it is normal to fear treatment-related side effects. It may help to know that your health care team will work to prevent and relieve side effects. Doctors call this part of cancer treatment “palliative care” or "supportive care." It is an important part of your treatment plan, regardless of your age or the stage of disease.

Coping with physical side effects
Common physical side effects from each treatment option for NSCLC are listed in the Types of Treatment section. Learn more about side effects of cancer and its treatment, along with ways to prevent or control them. Changes to your physical health depend on several factors, including the cancer’s stage, the length and dose of treatment, and your general health.

Talk with your health care team regularly about how you are feeling. It is important to let them know about any new side effects or changes in existing side effects. If they know how you are feeling, they can find ways to relieve or manage your side effects to help you feel more comfortable and potentially keep any side effects from worsening.

You may find it helpful to keep track of your side effects so it is easier to explain any changes to your health care team. Learn more about why tracking side effects is helpful.

Sometimes, physical side effects can last after treatment ends. Doctors call these long-term side effects. They call side effects that occur months or years after treatment late effects. Treating long-term side effects and late effects is an important part of survivorship care. Learn more by reading the Follow-up Care section of this guide or talking with your doctor.

Coping with emotional and social effects
You can have emotional and social effects as well as physical effects after a cancer diagnosis. This may include dealing with difficult emotions, such as sadness, anxiety, or anger, or managing your stress level. Sometimes, people find it difficult to express how they feel to their loved ones. Some have found that talking to an oncology social worker, counselor, or member of the clergy can help them develop more effective ways of coping and talking about cancer.

You can also find coping strategies for emotional and social effects in a separate section of this website. This section includes many resources for finding support and information to meet your needs.

Coping with financial effects
Cancer treatment can be expensive. It is often a big source of stress and anxiety for people with cancer and their families. In addition to treatment costs, many people find they have extra, unplanned expenses related to their care. For some people, the high cost of medical care stops them from following or completing their cancer treatment plan. This can put their health at risk and may lead to higher costs in the future. Patients and their families are encouraged to talk about financial concerns with a member of their health care team. Learn more about managing financial considerations in a separate part of this website.

Caring for a loved one with cancer
Family members and friends often play an important role in taking care of a person with NSCLC. This is called being a caregiver. Caregivers can provide physical, practical, and emotional support to the patient, even if they live far away.

Caregivers may have a range of responsibilities on a daily or as-needed basis, including:

Providing support and encouragement

Talking with the health care team

Giving medications

Helping manage symptoms and side effects

Coordinating medical appointments

Providing a ride to and from appointments

Assisting with meals

Helping with household chores

Handling insurance and billing issues

Although the main focus of caregivers is usually the person they are caring for, it is also important for caregivers to seek support. Such support may be available through family, friends, support groups specific for caregivers, or professional counselors. Learn more about caregiving.

Talking with your health care team about side effects
Before starting treatment, talk with your doctor about possible side effects. Ask:

Which side effects are most likely?

When are they likely to happen?

What can we do to prevent or relieve them?

Be sure to tell your health care team about any side effects that happen during treatment and afterward, too. Tell them even if you do not think the side effects are serious. This discussion should include physical, emotional, and social effects of cancer.

Also, ask how much care you may need at home and with daily tasks during and after treatment. This can help you make a caregiving plan. Create a caregiving plan with this 1-page fact sheet that includes an action plan to help make caregiving a team effort. This free fact sheet is available as a PDF, so it is easy to print out.

Lung Cancer - Non-Small Cell - Follow-Up Care
Approved by the Cancer.Net Editorial Board, 01/2019
ON THIS PAGE: You will read about your medical care after cancer treatment is completed and why this follow-up care is important. Use the menu to see other pages.

Care for people diagnosed with cancer does not end when active treatment has finished. Your health care team will continue to check that the cancer has not come back, manage any side effects, and monitor your overall health. This is called follow-up care.

Your follow-up care may include regular physical examinations, medical tests, or both. Doctors want to keep track of your recovery in the months and years ahead. Learn more about the importance of follow-up care.

Watching for recurrence or second cancer
One goal of follow-up care is to check for a recurrence, which means that the cancer has come back. Cancer recurs because small areas of cancer cells may remain undetected in the body. Over time, these cells may increase in number until they show up on test results or cause signs or symptoms. During follow-up care, a doctor familiar with your medical history can give you personalized information about your risk of recurrence. Some people may have blood tests or imaging tests done as part of regular follow-up care, but testing recommendations depend on several factors including the type and stage of cancer originally diagnosed and the types of treatment given.

People who develop NSCLC are at higher risk for developing a second lung cancer. Your doctor will recommend having future scans to watch for a recurrence so any new cancer can be found as early as possible.

The anticipation before having a follow-up test or waiting for test results can add stress to you or a family member. This is sometimes called “scan-xiety.” Learn more about how to cope with this type of stress.

Managing long-term and late side effects
Most people expect to experience side effects when receiving treatment. However, it is often surprising to survivors that some side effects may linger beyond the treatment period. These are called long-term side effects. Other side effects called late effects may develop months or even years afterwards. Long-term and late effects can include both physical and emotional changes.

Talk with your doctor about your risk of developing such side effects based on the type of cancer, your individual treatment plan, and your overall health. If you had a treatment known to cause specific late effects, you may have certain physical examinations, scans, or blood tests to help find and manage them.

Common post-treatment problems include pain, fatigue, and shortness of breath. Your doctor, nurse, and social worker can help you develop a plan to manage any problems that persist after treatment.

Survivors of NSCLC who have smoked cigarettes in the past also have a high risk of heart disease, stroke, emphysema, and chronic bronchitis. Certain cancer treatments can further increase these risks. Even for those who don’t smoke, healthy lifestyle choices after cancer are important for overall well-being.

Keeping personal health records
You and your doctor should work together to develop a personalized follow-up care plan. Be sure to discuss any concerns you have about your future physical or emotional health. ASCO offers forms to help keep track of the cancer treatment you received and develop a survivorship care plan when treatment is completed.

This is also a good time to talk with your doctor about who will lead your follow-up care. Some survivors continue to see their oncologist, while others transition back to the care of their family doctor or another health care professional. This decision depends on several factors, including the type and stage of cancer, side effects, health insurance rules, and your personal preferences.

If a doctor who was not directly involved in your cancer care will lead your follow-up care, be sure to share your cancer treatment summary and survivorship care plan forms with him or her and with all future health care providers. Details about your cancer treatment are very valuable to the health care professionals who will care for you throughout your lifetime.

Lung Cancer - Non-Small Cell - Survivorship
Approved by the Cancer.Net Editorial Board, 01/2019
ON THIS PAGE: You will read about how to with challenges in everyday life after a cancer diagnosis. Use the menu to see other pages.

What is survivorship?
The word “survivorship” means different things to different people. Common definitions include:

Having no signs of cancer after finishing treatment.

Living with, through, and beyond cancer. According to this definition, cancer survivorship begins at diagnosis and includes people who continue to have treatment over the long term, to either reduce the risk of recurrence or to manage chronic disease.

Survivorship is one of the most complicated parts of having cancer. This is because it is different for everyone.

Survivors may experience a mixture of strong feelings, including joy, concern, relief, guilt, and fear. Some people say they appreciate life more after a cancer diagnosis and have gained a greater acceptance of themselves. Others become very anxious about their health and uncertain about coping with everyday life.

Survivors may feel some stress when their frequent visits to the health care team end after completing treatment. Often, relationships built with the cancer care team provide a sense of security during treatment, and people miss this source of support. This may be especially true when new worries and challenges surface over time, such as any late effects of treatment, emotional challenges including fear of recurrence, sexual health and fertility concerns, and financial and workplace issues.

Every survivor has individual concerns and challenges. With any challenge, a good first step is being able to recognize your fears and talk about them. Effective coping requires:

Understanding the challenge you are facing

Thinking through solutions

Asking for and allowing the support of others

Feeling comfortable with the course of action you choose

Many survivors find it helpful to join an in-person support group or an online community of survivors. This allows you to talk with people who have had similar first-hand experiences. Other options for finding support include talking with a friend or member of your health care team, individual counseling, or asking for assistance at the learning resource center of the place where you received treatment.

Changing role of caregivers
Family members and friends may also go through periods of transition. A caregiver plays a very important role in supporting a person diagnosed with cancer, providing physical, emotional, and practical care on a daily or as-needed basis. Many caregivers become focused on providing this support, especially if the treatment period lasts for many months or longer.

However, as treatment is completed, the caregiver's role often changes. Caregivers may also view the transition into survivorship differently than the patient, especially if they are not actively involved in ongoing follow-up care.

Eventually, the need for caregiving related to the cancer diagnosis will become much less or come to an end. Caregivers can learn more about adjusting to life after caregiving.

A new perspective on your health
For many people, survivorship serves as a strong motivator to make lifestyle changes.

Nothing helps recovery more than stopping smoking. There are many tools and approaches available. Be sure to get help from your family, friends, nurses, and doctors because it is difficult to stop on your own.

People recovering from lung cancer are encouraged to follow established guidelines for good health, such as not smoking, limiting alcohol, eating well, and managing stress. Regular physical activity can help rebuild your strength and energy level. Recovering patients, even those using oxygen, are encouraged to walk for 15 to 30 minutes each day to improve their heart and lung functioning. Your health care team can help you create an appropriate exercise plan based on your needs, physical abilities, and fitness level. Learn more about making healthy lifestyle choices.

It is important to have recommended medical checkups and tests (see Follow-up Care) to take care of your health. Cancer rehabilitation may be recommended, and this could mean any of a wide range of services such as physical therapy, career counseling, pain management, nutritional planning, and/or emotional counseling. The goal of rehabilitation is to help people regain control over many aspects of their lives and remain as independent and productive as possible.

Talk with your health care team to develop a survivorship care plan that is best for your needs.
