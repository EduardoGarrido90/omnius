"But this wasn't always the case. Today, smoking causes nearly 9 out of 10 lung cancer deaths, while radon gas, pollution, and other things play a smaller role"
smoking -> Lung Cancer (constantly)
radon gas -> Lung Cancer (hardly ever)
secondhand smoke -> Lung Cancer (hardly ever)
"Cigs = lung cancer & DEATH" 
Smoking -> Lung Cancer (always)
Lung Cancer -> Death (always)
